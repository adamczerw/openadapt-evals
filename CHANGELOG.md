# CHANGELOG


## Unreleased

### Bug Fixes

- Don't send temperature to Claude models that reject sampling params
  ([`a73e748`](https://github.com/adamczerw/openadapt-evals/commit/a73e74819efe9607039a077c4972bc0ffe107552))

Opus 4.7/4.8, Opus 5/5.5, Sonnet 5, Fable and Mythos models return a 400 when temperature is set.

- Write the benchmark viewer HTML as UTF-8
  ([`115da35`](https://github.com/adamczerw/openadapt-evals/commit/115da35237963c2eadf51a19005538f7d8dd6c38))

- Ask the planner for precise grounding targets
  ([`65418c9`](https://github.com/adamczerw/openadapt-evals/commit/65418c9e2bb33b83fcbca12076f60f03bab317de))

- Make LocalAdapter act on the selected monitor
  ([`0094e8f`](https://github.com/adamczerw/openadapt-evals/commit/0094e8f8eca013e66317d281cc0f149c8bfd9bec))

Clicks and drags are offset by the selected monitor's position, normalized (0-1) coordinates are
  scaled to the monitor, and "win"/"windows" are accepted as key names.

### Features

- Add OmniParserGrounder for PlannerGrounderAgent
  ([`df15a73`](https://github.com/adamczerw/openadapt-evals/commit/df15a73de58818159bbf98a9317b4cc8b879aa3a))

OmniParser detects UI elements, a small VLM picks the one matching the planner's target, and the
  grounder clicks its center. Install with `pip install openadapt-evals[omniparser]`.


## v0.87.0 (2026-04-01)

### Features

- Demo enrichment pipeline for GroundingTarget data
  ([#261](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/261),
  [`dd01054`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/dd01054723fc7b88416c2010691324247dd551cf))

Add two scripts for populating GroundingTarget data on demo click steps:

- enrich_demo_targets.py: Enriches each click step with GroundingTarget metadata (target_type,
  crop_bbox, click_offset, nearby_text) using OCR when real screenshots are available, or
  description-derived heuristics when they are not. Idempotent and works offline.

- record_demo_screenshots.py: Replays a demo on a live WAA VM, capturing before/after screenshots at
  each step, then updates the demo JSON with real screenshot paths for subsequent enrichment.

Both scripts use fire for CLI, handle the existing demo JSON format, and integrate with grounding.py
  GroundingTarget.to_dict()/from_dict().

## v0.86.0 (2026-04-01)

### Features

- Add GLM-OCR as primary OCR backend, pytesseract as fallback
  ([#260](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/260),
  [`c66468a`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/c66468a07fc98643936572fe75af8cc265a13c95))

run_ocr() now tries backends in order: 1. GLM-OCR (VLM-based, pip install glmocr, better accuracy on
  complex UIs) 2. pytesseract (traditional OCR, requires system Tesseract binary) 3. Empty list
  (graceful degradation)

Added [ocr] optional dependency group for glmocr.

## v0.85.0 (2026-03-31)

### Features

- Ocr text anchoring (Tier 1.5a) for grounding cascade
  ([#259](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/259),
  [`aa797dd`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/aa797dd2c01ce6803cf81b7f1a16464dcb05cad7))

Add Phase 5 text anchoring on top of Phase 4 state narrowing:

- grounding.py: run_ocr() with pytesseract (optional dep, graceful fallback), ground_by_text() with
  tiered scoring (exact/case-insensitive/ substring/fuzzy) and nearby-text proximity boost, plus
  helper functions _char_overlap_ratio, _bbox_center, _bbox_distance.

- demo_executor.py: _try_text_anchoring() method inserted before VLM grounder calls for
  click/double_click actions. Returns action if best OCR candidate scores > 0.85, otherwise falls
  through to Tier 2.

- tests/test_text_anchoring.py: 21 tests covering all scoring tiers, proximity boost, edge cases,
  and graceful pytesseract fallback. All tests use mocked OCR results (no pytesseract required).

## v0.84.0 (2026-03-31)

### Features

- State narrowing and transition verification for grounding cascade
  ([#257](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/257),
  [`e22b404`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e22b404cd6ebd618a06c5a9748315d2a6ecd910e))

Phase 4 of the grounding cascade — detect "wrong screen" before grounding and verify state changes
  after clicking.

Added to grounding.py: - check_state_preconditions(): verifies window title, nearby text, and
  surrounding labels match expectations before grounding a click. Skips gracefully when no OCR
  function is provided (Phase 5). - verify_transition(): checks disappearance_text, appearance_text,
  and window_title_change against post-click screenshot via OCR. Modal detection deferred (logged,
  not enforced). - _text_present(): case-insensitive substring matching helper.

Integrated into DemoExecutor.run(): - Pre-click: calls check_state_preconditions for
  click/double_click steps with a grounding_target. Observational only (warns, proceeds). -
  Post-click: calls verify_transition after action dispatch. Observational only (warns, proceeds).

Tests (26 new): - 11 tests for check_state_preconditions (no-OCR, no-expectations, window title
  match/mismatch, nearby text, surrounding labels, case insensitivity, combined checks) - 11 tests
  for verify_transition (no-expectations, no-OCR, appearance/disappearance, window title change,
  modal skip, combined scenarios) - 4 tests for GroundingTarget round-trip serialization

## v0.83.0 (2026-03-31)

### Features

- Groundingtarget + GroundingCandidate data model for cascade architecture
  ([#256](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/256),
  [`e912b65`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e912b653942424513b4762fdbae8051c0b71c3b3))

Phase 3 of the grounding cascade design (v3):

- grounding.py: GroundingTarget (rich target per click step — description, crop, nearby text, window
  title, structured transition expectations) and GroundingCandidate (normalized output from each
  grounding tier) - demo_library.py: DemoStep gains optional grounding_target field,
  serialization/deserialization handles GroundingTarget objects - Fix demo description: "Clear data"
  → "Clear now" (actual button text) - Design docs: v1, v2, v3 cascade architecture

GroundingTarget is the foundation for the entire cascade. Every downstream tier (OCR, CLIP,
  UI-Venus, GPT-5.4) operates on the same rich signal instead of a weak description string.

## v0.82.4 (2026-03-30)

### Bug Fixes

- Configurable max_grad_norm, lower default lr, remove premature deprecation
  ([#255](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/255),
  [`321dcea`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/321dceac303d61a416b25ca9624dedc1b3a90da9))

Three changes based on client training results (grad_norm=101, 0.00 eval delta):

1. Add max_grad_norm to TrainingConfig (was hardcoded to 1.0). When grad_norm >> max_grad_norm,
  gradients are clipped to a near-random direction — training makes no progress despite non-zero
  loss. Now warns when grad_norm > 10x the clip threshold.

2. Lower default learning_rate from 5e-6 to 1e-6. With grad_norm=101 and lr=5e-6, effective step
  size overshoots. lr=1e-6 with max_grad_norm=1.0 gives stable updates.

3. Remove "standalone trainer is deprecated" warning. It was premature — TRL's rollout_func doesn't
  support multimodal VLMs (issue #5120). The standalone trainer is the production training path
  until TRL PR #5323 merges.

## v0.82.3 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Also patch model.generate() to inject cached pixel_values
  ([#254](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/254),
  [`9612019`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/96120198f5cd413675b37c6752fe0f2c79dae78e))

forward() patch handles training logprob recomputation, but TRL also calls
  model.generate(input_ids=...) without pixel_values. HF's generate() uses
  prepare_inputs_for_generation() which builds a fresh kwargs dict — cached pixel_values in
  forward() aren't enough because generate() needs them at the top level to pass them through.

Now patches BOTH forward() and generate() on the model instance.

## v0.82.2 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Patch model.forward() directly instead of wrapper class
  ([#253](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/253),
  [`0f381b1`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/0f381b1c6ff0de3c2ff2e9f89cde91542df71e2f))

TRL unwraps models via Accelerate, stripping wrapper classes. The fix: patch forward() on the model
  instance itself. This survives unwrapping.

- patch_model_for_trl(model) → returns cache_fn - cache_fn(inputs) caches pixel_values from
  processor output - Patched forward() injects cached pixel_values when TRL omits them - Patched
  __call__ also injects (covers all call paths) - trl_wrapper passes original model to TRL (not a
  wrapper) - cache_vision_fn passed through to rollout_func

## v0.82.1 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Vlmmodelwrapper PEFT isinstance compatibility for TRL validation
  ([#252](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/252),
  [`7879dee`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/7879deef1bc1a50ae3292b3f9861a6a9c5910ac6))

TRL's validate_quantization_for_training() uses isinstance(model, PeftModel) to check for adapters.
  The wrapper hid the PeftModel, causing: "You cannot perform fine-tuning on purely quantized
  models."

Fix: dynamically create a combined class inheriting from both

VLMModelWrapper and the wrapped model's type. This makes isinstance() pass while keeping our
  forward/generate/cache methods via MRO.

Tests added: - test_peft_attributes_delegated: peft_config accessible through wrapper -
  test_hasattr_peft_config: hasattr() works for TRL's checks - test_isinstance_peft_model:
  isinstance(wrapper, PeftModel) == True - test_wrapper_passes_peft_validation (e2e): full TRL
  validation sim - test_wrapper_preserves_trainable_parameters (e2e): optimizer setup

## v0.82.0 (2026-03-29)

### Features

- Vlmmodelwrapper — multimodal compatibility layer for TRL
  ([#251](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/251),
  [`fa26d55`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/fa26d553d05e6bcae1f41191d52375331888095e))

* feat: VLMModelWrapper — multimodal compatibility layer for TRL

TRL's GRPOTrainer calls model.forward(input_ids=...) during training without pixel_values. VLMs need
  pixel_values to produce meaningful logits. Without them, the model is blind and generates garbage.

VLMModelWrapper caches vision tensors during rollout generation (when we have the images) and
  injects them during TRL's forward pass. This is the standard adapter pattern — 120 lines, no TRL
  internals modified.

- vlm_wrapper.py: VLMModelWrapper with cache_vision_inputs + forward - trl_wrapper.py: wraps model
  before passing to GRPOTrainer - trl_rollout.py: calls cache_vision_inputs before model.generate -
  9 tests covering injection, delegation, cache behavior, warnings

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* test: add e2e tests for VLM+TRL pipeline and wrapper integration

5 e2e tests (@pytest.mark.heavy, CPU-only, skipped in CI): - test_generation_sees_pixel_values:
  model not blind during rollout - test_trl_forward_gets_cached_pixel_values: wrapper injects into
  TRL - test_output_format_not_garbage: prompt has DSL format guidance -
  test_no_thinking_tokens_in_template: no <think> in chat template - test_vision_changes_logits:
  pixel_values actually affect logits

2 integration tests (light, runs in CI): - test_wrapper_used_in_train_source: VLMModelWrapper in
  trl_wrapper - test_generate_fn_calls_cache_vision_inputs: cache call in rollout

Each test maps to a bug class from the March 29 session. Together they prevent the entire class of
  multimodal TRL failures before they reach the customer.

## v0.81.9 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Patch chat_template to remove <think> tags at the source
  ([#250](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/250),
  [`c1d3588`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/c1d35883851ad111f049167051e71e9a44e7819d))

Stripping <think> from rendered text was insufficient — TRL or the processor may re-apply the
  template, re-inserting the tags. The fix: patch processor.chat_template and
  processor.tokenizer.chat_template on first rollout call, removing <think>/<think> from the Jinja
  template itself. This ensures no code path can re-insert thinking mode.

Also strips </think> (was missed in #249).

## v0.81.8 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Disable Qwen3.5 thinking mode in TRL generation
  ([#249](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/249),
  [`5a2bf7f`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/5a2bf7f7d6dc262608fba994b02cfbce50eaa811))

Root cause of persistent garbage output: Qwen3.5-9B's chat template inserts <think> which activates
  internal reasoning mode. The model produces opaque thinking tokens (# # # # #) instead of DSL
  actions.

Fix: pass enable_thinking=False to apply_chat_template. Falls back to

stripping <think> from rendered text if the kwarg is not supported.

## v0.81.7 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Comprehensive prompt diagnostics for debugging garbage output
  ([#248](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/248),
  [`8e3bc45`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/8e3bc45097231e35060c30e0064753c4dea527d1))

Adds detailed one-time logging to help debug the persistent garbage output issue:

1. Raw messages (role, content types, text preview) before chat template 2. Full rendered text_input
  (2000 chars, not 300) 3. Image metadata (mode, size, format) 4. Generation config (max_new_tokens,
  temperature, constrained, model type) 5. First generation output (500 chars + token count) 6.
  Input tensor shapes (input_ids, attention_mask, pixel_values, image_grid_thw)

The tensor shape logging is critical: if pixel_values is MISSING, the model isn't seeing the
  screenshot — which would explain degenerate output regardless of prompt correctness.

## v0.81.6 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Use build_agent_messages for TRL prompt + fix 4x over-generation
  ([#247](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/247),
  [`1d94899`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/1d948996a117b8d9a20430e28ed631fb8361b8cc))

Two critical fixes:

1. Garbage output root cause: TRL constructed user messages differently from the standalone trainer.
  Standalone wraps instruction with "Goal:" prefix, format guidance, and {"type": "image"}
  placeholder. TRL passed raw instruction text. Now imports build_agent_messages from
  standalone.prompt so both paths produce identical messages.

2. 4x over-generation: batch_size=num_gen with padded dataset caused 4 identical prompts × 4
  generations = 16 rollouts (standalone does 4). Now: batch_size=1, generation_batch_size=num_gen.
  One unique prompt per step with num_gen rollouts. No dataset padding needed.

Also adds one-time prompt logging for operator verification.

## v0.81.5 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Wire on_before_collect and on_rollout_complete callbacks through rollout_func
  ([#243](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/243),
  [`fc40bf4`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/fc40bf40784482a20a49600dd95b151b1342d6b7))

* fix: add truncation warning to TRL generate paths

Add a truncation check after both generation paths (Outlines constrained and HF unconstrained) in
  generate_fn. When the output length reaches max_new_tokens - 1, a warning is logged suggesting to
  increase max_new_tokens or enable constrained_decoding. This helps diagnose cases where the model
  generates excessively long reasoning that gets cut off before producing a parseable action.

Also replaced the tautological truncation tests in test_trl_robustness.py (which reimplemented the
  check logic inline) with tests that exercise the actual generate_fn code path by calling it
  through the rollout function with mocked torch and model.generate.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: wire on_before_collect and on_rollout_complete callbacks through rollout_func

The GRPOTrainer wrapper accepted on_before_collect and on_rollout_complete callbacks but silently
  ignored them. HookBridge stored them but only implemented on_step_end (for on_step_complete). TRL
  has no pre-rollout callback event, so these must fire from within make_waa_rollout_func.

Changes: - Add on_before_collect and on_rollout_complete params to make_waa_rollout_func - Fire
  on_before_collect(task_id, env) before each episode - Fire on_rollout_complete(rollout_dict,
  gen_idx) after each episode - Wrap both in try/except so broken callbacks cannot crash training -
  Pass callbacks from GRPOTrainer.train() to make_waa_rollout_func - Remove these two callbacks from
  HookBridge (keep only on_step_complete)

## v0.81.4 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Add truncation warning to TRL generate paths
  ([#242](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/242),
  [`e71ed9f`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e71ed9fe17168524963b564aa050bb4d4d4d305e))

- Use training-appropriate evaluate timeouts instead of reordering eval
  ([#246](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/246),
  [`114ad0e`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/114ad0e8bdc33c35a966ba820ad958fba4269550))

Reverts the evaluate_dense reordering from #245 (local-first was too aggressive — skipped binary
  eval entirely, losing the signal when 5050 IS available).

The actual fix: set evaluate_timeout=15s and evaluate_retries=1 on the WAALiveAdapter in the TRL
  wrapper. The evaluate_dense logic stays correct (try binary first, local fallback, take max).
  Training speed comes from fast failure, not from skipping evaluation paths.

- Benchmarking: 180s timeout, 3 retries (thorough, one-shot) - Training: 15s timeout, 1 retry (fast
  feedback, thousands of evals)

### Testing

- Add 10 TRL parity tests for deprecation readiness
  ([#241](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/241),
  [`6a38956`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/6a38956f3da2776701b0b92b94134609e83f4d4d))

Adds tests/test_trl_parity.py with 25 test cases covering the 10 areas identified in
  docs/STANDALONE_VS_TRL_COMPARISON.md as needed before the standalone GRPO trainer can be
  deprecated:

1. Constrained decoding — Outlines generator build + ACTION_REGEX 2. Constrained decoding
  ImportError — returns None, not silent success 3. Prompt format identity — TRL imports
  SYSTEM_PROMPT from standalone 4. DSL round-trip parsing — CLICK, TYPE, WAIT, DONE via
  parse_action_json 5. Thought-prefix parsing — "Thought: ...\nAction: DSL" format 6. Unsloth
  loading — FastVisionModel.from_pretrained + get_peft_model 7. LoRA checkpoint resume —
  lora_checkpoint passed through config 8. HookBridge on_step_complete — callback fires with correct
  args 9. HookBridge unused hooks — on_before_collect/on_rollout_complete stored 10. _AgentOutput
  schema — Pydantic validation, JSON schema, roundtrip

All tests are light (no torch/transformers/trl imports), use unittest.mock, and pass with [dev] deps
  only.

## v0.81.3 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Try local eval before slow /evaluate endpoint in evaluate_dense
  ([#245](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/245),
  [`3b8c1c2`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/3b8c1c2b6317a693fec2e97cf8aa459205f1be4d))

51% of TRL training time wasted on 5050 evaluate timeouts (180s × 3 retries = 9 min per evaluation).
  The local evaluation via evaluate_checks_local takes ~5s.

Fix: when task config has checks defined, try local eval FIRST. Only

fall through to the slow /evaluate endpoint when no local checks exist. This eliminates the 9-minute
  timeout for custom YAML tasks that define their own checks.

Before: evaluate() [9 min] → if 0.0 → local [5s]

After: local [5s] → if no checks → evaluate() [9 min]

## v0.81.2 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Batch_size must be multiple of num_generations, pad dataset if needed
  ([#244](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/244),
  [`d6e1b5b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/d6e1b5bff59d672e5ec74126d35302f852ffe09a))

TRL requires generation_batch_size % num_generations == 0. With batch_size=1 and num_generations=4,
  TRL rejects it. Fix:

1. Set per_device_train_batch_size = num_generations (minimum valid) 2. Pad dataset by repeating
  tasks if len(dataset) < batch_size

With 1 task and num_generations=4: dataset padded to 4 rows, batch_size=4, generation_batch_size=4,
  4 % 4 == 0 ✓

## v0.81.1 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Set per_device_train_batch_size to match dataset size
  ([#240](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/240),
  [`048796c`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/048796c020a474293758ff8a95ed6ef520f41fbf))

* fix: set per_device_train_batch_size to match dataset size

TRL's default per_device_train_batch_size=8, but with 1-3 tasks the dataset is too small to form a
  single batch. TRL computes 0 steps and exits with "There seems not to be a single sample in your
  epoch_iterator".

Fix: set batch_size=n_tasks when building default GRPOConfig. When the

user provides their own trl_config, warn if batch_size > dataset size.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: use batch_size=1 instead of n_tasks to avoid OOM with many tasks

batch_size=n_tasks could OOM on GPU with many tasks. batch_size=1 is safer and matches the
  standalone trainer behavior (one task per step, rotating through tasks via epochs). Each step
  still does num_generations rollouts, so learning signal is preserved.

## v0.81.0 (2026-03-29)

### Features

- Add DiagnosticsCallback and TRL robustness tests
  ([#238](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/238),
  [`d7896d5`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/d7896d562135366fce600bba9e5b342699b3ee09))

- Add DiagnosticsCallback to trl_callbacks.py: logs loss, |loss|, grad_norm, reward in scientific
  notation (matches standalone trainer diagnostic output) - Register DiagnosticsCallback in
  trl_wrapper.py alongside TelemetryCallback - Add test_trl_robustness.py: 19 tests covering health
  check, corrupt screenshot retry, stuck detection, truncation warning, diagnostics callback, and
  empty rollout result shape

Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- Add openadapt-types dependency and _AgentOutput schema
  ([#239](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/239),
  [`fb7e87f`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/fb7e87f5a728bb0a05226765d5440a273de6f7b2))

- Add openadapt-types>=0.1.0 to core dependencies (canonical action schema for the OpenAdapt
  ecosystem — Pydantic v2, lightweight) - Add _AgentOutput Pydantic model for future Outlines JSON
  schema constrained decoding (currently unused — default is DSL regex) - Does NOT change the system
  prompt (DSL format, matching #236 fix)

The _AgentOutput model enables switching to outlines.json(model, schema) once models are SFT'd on
  JSON format. For now, DSL regex remains default.

## v0.80.2 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Critical TRL trainer bugs — wrong prompt, ignored task_ids, DSL parsing
  ([#236](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/236),
  [`de515b8`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/de515b8cde49ffd0e08a0097f9857c042d4c017a))

* fix: critical TRL trainer bugs — wrong prompt, ignored task_ids, DSL parsing

Three bugs reported from client testing the TRL path:

1. Garbage output: TRL used a JSON system prompt but the model was SFT'd on DSL format
  (Thought/Action). Now imports SYSTEM_PROMPT from the standalone trainer so both paths use the
  identical prompt.

2. task_ids ignored: trl_wrapper loaded ALL tasks from task_dir into the TRL dataset, ignoring
  TrainingConfig.task_ids. Now filters task_configs by task_ids when specified (matching by id or
  name).

3. parse_action_json only handled JSON: constrained decoding produces DSL (CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.3)), but
  the parser only tried JSON. Now falls back to DSL regex parsing, keeping fractional coordinates
  for pixel_action.

* fix: configurable system_prompt, loud Outlines failure, mock-safe health check

- Add system_prompt parameter to make_waa_rollout_func (default = DSL prompt from standalone
  trainer). Users can override if they SFT on a different format. - Log the system prompt at startup
  for debugging. - Make Outlines failure loud: ImportError raises instead of silent fallback. Other
  failures log CRITICAL warning. - Fix health check to skip mock adapters (unittest.mock.MagicMock).
  - Fix test mocks to accept **kwargs for stuck_threshold.

## v0.80.1 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Add triple-layer CI protection against heavy import failures
  ([#235](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/235),
  [`7a202c9`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/7a202c9d93341ff29258c03c00c6d29e9786fbc5))

* fix: add triple-layer CI protection against heavy import failures

- Add pytest markers (heavy, gpu, vm) to pyproject.toml - Guard test_vision_loss.py with
  importorskip("torch") + @heavy marker - Guard test_api_agent_ml.py with
  importorskip("openadapt_ml") + @heavy marker - Add CI lint step that fails on bare top-level
  imports of heavy packages - Replace ad-hoc --ignore with marker-based deselection (-m "not heavy")
  - Add comprehensive standalone vs TRL trainer comparison doc

Triple protection: markers (intentional categorization), importorskip (graceful skip), lint guard
  (preventive). This prevents the class of CI failure where a test imports torch/transformers at
  module level.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* docs: update comparison with openadapt-types finding

openadapt-types already provides the canonical Action schema (Pydantic v2) that converges
  BenchmarkAction, openadapt-ml Action, and omnimcp types. Recommendation: import from
  openadapt-types instead of creating new schemas.

* fix: TelemetryCallback __bases__ crash + 12 TRL integration tests

The dynamic __bases__ assignment to inject TrainerCallback as a base class fails in Python:
  "deallocator differs from object". Fixed by creating a proper subclass at definition time instead.

12 new tests: - Mock rollout_func: correct keys, count, reward variance - Config separation:
  TrainingConfig has no TRL fields, wrapper accepts trl_config - Wrapper construction: all callback
  combinations, trl_config passthrough - TelemetryCallback: importable, fires events

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* docs: telemetry guide — how to disable globally with one line

DO_NOT_TRACK=1 in .env disables all telemetry. Already supported, just needed documentation. Covers
  what we collect, what we don't, privacy scrubbing, CI behavior, and source code links.

## v0.79.2 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Telemetrycallback __bases__ crash + 12 TRL integration tests
  ([#231](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/231),
  [`ac2df2f`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/ac2df2f9d9dece530648a97101e31d0039c1c805))

The dynamic __bases__ assignment to inject TrainerCallback as a base class fails in Python:
  "deallocator differs from object". Fixed by creating a proper subclass at definition time instead.

12 new tests: - Mock rollout_func: correct keys, count, reward variance - Config separation:

Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>


## v0.79.1 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Clean config separation — our config + TRL's config, no duplication
  ([#230](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/230),
  [`1c23f0b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/1c23f0b0082040580ea37f1e56e82e53fe1cc766))

TrainingConfig owns OpenAdapt concerns: model, task_dir, server_url, constrained_decoding,
  max_new_tokens, use_unsloth, weave_project.

TRL's GRPOConfig owns training concerns: loss_type, learning_rate, batch_size,
  gradient_accumulation, vLLM, bf16, W&B reporting.

The wrapper accepts both via trl_config kwarg:

trainer = GRPOTrainer( TrainingConfig(task_dir="tasks/", constrained_decoding=True),
  trl_config=GRPOConfig(loss_type="dapo", num_generations=4), on_step_complete=my_logger, )

If trl_config is omitted, sensible defaults are built from TrainingConfig.

## v0.79.0 (2026-03-29)

### Features

- Trl GRPOTrainer migration with drop-in Python wrapper
  ([#229](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/229),
  [`f7d840c`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/f7d840c1089e403a01256de8db18e1b2af32de87))

TRL integration: - Outlines constrained decoding ported to rollout_func - TelemetryCallback maps to
  our telemetry events - train_trl_grpo.py: --constrained-decoding, --weave-project, --no-telemetry
  - README: TRL training section with 4 usage examples

Drop-in Python wrapper (trl_wrapper.py): - Same API as standalone trainer: TrainingConfig + 4
  callback hooks - Internally uses TRL GRPOTrainer + rollout_func - Client code doesn't change: from
  openadapt_evals.training.trl_wrapper import GRPOTrainer trainer = GRPOTrainer(config,
  on_step_complete=my_logger) trainer.train()

Standalone trainer: - Deprecated with warning (not removed) - Falls back if TRL not installed

## v0.78.2 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Remove remaining 125 tracked data files (waa_recordings, .beads)
  ([`d000f5d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/d000f5d78af487ef2ea0a2e6d168c39fb06c92a0))

These were committed before PR #227 and missed in the first cleanup. waa_recordings/ contains WAA
  experiment screenshots (PNGs). .beads/ contains a SQLite database for local tooling.

Both are already in .gitignore from the prior cleanup commit.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>


## v0.78.1 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Remove 307 accidentally committed data files, update .gitignore
  ([`ee1ceb9`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/ee1ceb9bd20b37d8f742c7b9a3657f8a59a8155f))

PR #227 accidentally committed local experiment data via git add -A: - flywheel_results/ (224
  screenshots + JSON) - .claude/worktrees/ (31 agent gitlinks) - annotated_demos/ (16 files) -
  eval_results/ (11 screenshots) - grpo_output/ (1 file) - demos/*/synthetic_correction/
  (placeholder PNGs) - .beads/ (SQLite database)

All removed from tracking. .gitignore updated to prevent reoccurrence. No sensitive data was exposed
  (confirmed via tidy scan).

## v0.78.0 (2026-03-29)

### Features

- Weave (W&B) integration for LLM/agent tracing
  ([#228](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/228),
  [`6d9fcb7`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/6d9fcb704e0ea0d4f1e7d2beff927a64e2676d48))

Weave auto-patches OpenAI and Anthropic clients after weave.init(), giving automatic tracing of
  every VLM call with prompts, responses, costs, and latency in hierarchical trace trees.

Integration points: - vlm_call() — @weave_op: all planner/grounder/evaluator calls traced -
  vlm_judge() — @weave_op: milestone evaluation traced - DemoExecutor.run() + _execute_step() —
  @weave_op: episode trace tree - PlannerGrounderAgent.act() + _call_planner() — @weave_op: agent
  decisions - WandbLogger.init() — calls weave_init() alongside wandb.init()

When weave is not installed, all decorators are zero-cost passthrough. weave>=0.50.0 added to
  [wandb] optional extra.

76/76 tests pass.

## v0.77.5 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Diagnostic logging (loss scientific notation, grad_norm, advantages)
  ([#227](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/227),
  [`74fd646`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/74fd6466bcd22a203e7e1ff1ba7a6a787355f75f))

loss=0.0000 was misleading: %.4f truncation + symmetric advantages canceling. Now logs loss in
  scientific notation, absolute loss per rollout, gradient norm, and per-rollout advantages.

13 vision loss tests (was 12). New test verifies loss_abs > 0 and advantages are symmetric with
  reward variance.

### Testing

- Synthetic vision-merge model proves fix correctness
  ([#226](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/226),
  [`2355d53`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/2355d53ae7de4e1823b742377122550e498ec9f2))

VisionMergeModel mimics Qwen2.5/3.5-VL: replaces placeholder tokens with N visual features, changing
  sequence length. 4 new tests:

- test_manual_concat_crashes: OLD approach → IndexError (mask mismatch) -
  test_unified_processor_works: NEW approach → correct post-merge shape - test_no_vision_no_merge:
  no pixel_values → no merge → mask safe - test_exclude_strips_vision: exclude mode → no
  pixel_values → safe

Architecture-agnostic. 12/12 pass in 0.05s.

Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- Vision loss computation tests (8 tests)
  ([#225](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/225),
  [`b488794`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/b488794027dffd04d24a3dc352d5ad24a3cc61e9))

Would have caught the Qwen3 vision merge crash before shipping. 8/8 pass in 0.07s, no GPU, uses real
  tiny nn.Module.

Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>


## v0.77.4 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Proper vision-safe loss — process full text as one unit
  ([#224](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/224),
  [`5413864`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/5413864342a71f3cead106d640e5ba6adc5fae95))

Root cause: manually concatenating action_ids onto prompt input_ids created inconsistent input
  (pixel_values sized for prompt, input_ids includes action tokens). Qwen3's vision merge changes
  internal sequence length, crashing with attention mask mismatches.

Fix: process prompt_text + action_text as a SINGLE string through the

processor. Produces consistent input_ids, pixel_values, attention_mask. The model handles vision
  merge correctly on processor output.

Replaces the silent fallback from PR #223 with a proper solution that gives correct vision-aware
  gradients for ALL steps in ALL modes.

## v0.77.3 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Vision loss forward pass falls back to exclude on crash
  ([#223](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/223),
  [`d348f1b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/d348f1b6bca44cc4d94ccff0695351b9f90c6ed1))

Qwen3's vision-language merge changes internal sequence length unpredictably. Both include and
  checkpoint modes crash intermittently with attention mask mismatches (mask too large OR too small
  depending on generated sequence length).

Fix: catch IndexError/RuntimeError from the vision forward pass and

retry with exclude mode (text-only, no vision tensors) for that step. Training never crashes — some
  steps get vision-aware gradients, some get text-only gradients, but all steps contribute to
  learning.

This is the pragmatic fix. The proper fix (capturing logits during generation to avoid re-forward
  entirely) is future work.

## v0.77.2 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Add numpy to dev dependencies for CI
  ([#221](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/221),
  [`6a0374a`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/6a0374a25c4ea4e0b3808ac9cc0780ee89a7f087))

test_workflow_models.py and workflow pipeline import numpy directly. Was transitive via
  openadapt-ml, now needed as dev dep.

Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

### Testing

- Demoexecutor e2e tests with mock WAA environment
  ([#222](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/222),
  [`8e6f685`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/8e6f685e94a61425df3e563623ece79690c7e44a))

12 tests covering the full DemoExecutor pipeline: - Keyboard-only demo: 3 steps execute in order,
  all Tier 1 - Mixed demo: click uses grounder, keyboard bypasses it - Evaluation: dense score with
  milestones, binary without - Telemetry: start/completed events with tier counts - Edge cases:
  empty demo, missing values, unknown action types

All tests use MockEnv (no WAA server, no HTTP, no API keys). 12/12 pass in 0.05s.

## v0.77.1 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Add PyYAML to core dependencies ([#220](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/220),
  [`0d0616e`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/0d0616e71699897f2d83c744e8c17c6337529695))

PyYAML was a transitive dependency via openadapt-ml. Now that ml is optional (PR #218), yaml import
  fails in CI. TaskConfig uses yaml directly — it must be a core dep.

Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

### Chores

- Phase 0a dead code cleanup + fix corrupt screenshot crash
  ([#219](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/219),

Dead code removed: - scripts/core4_eval.py — trial-specific runner, superseded by run_full_eval.py -
  scripts/core4_lane.py — same

Corrupt screenshot fix: - _collect_rollout catches SyntaxError/OSError from PIL when WAA returns
  truncated PNG data (HTTP 200 but corrupt body) - Retries screenshot once after 2s delay -
  Previously crashed the entire training run

## v0.77.0 (2026-03-29)

### Features

- Make openadapt-ml an optional dependency (Phase 0b)
  ([#218](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/218),
  [`2615c26`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/2615c26b9c694f7c058b72601b93cfbce7eaa66c))

Move openadapt-ml from core dependencies to [ml] optional extra. pip install openadapt-evals now
  completes in ~30 seconds (no torch). pip install openadapt-evals[ml] gets the full ML stack.

Changes: - pyproject.toml: openadapt-ml removed from deps, added as [ml] extra - trace_export.py:
  guard top-level openadapt_ml.schema import with try/except (only file with unguarded import) - 20
  guardrail tests verify core modules import without ml: standalone trainer, DemoExecutor,
  DemoLibrary, TaskConfig, telemetry, WAAConnection, RLEnvironment, BenchmarkAction all work without
  ml - Client import pattern tested: GRPOTrainer, TrainingConfig, WAAConnection, wandb_callbacks,
  TaskConfig, DemoLibrary

The [training] extra still pulls in openadapt-ml[training] for users who need the full RL training
  stack.

## v0.76.3 (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Vision_loss_mode checkpoint/include attention mask mismatch
  ([#217](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/217),
  [`0617226`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/06172262ad5a91a2d7aa156b71f004b55b8b4c00))

Qwen3's vision-language merge changes internal sequence length (e.g., 1305 raw tokens → 1202
  post-merge). The trainer was constructing attention_mask from input_ids shape (1305), causing
  IndexError when the model expected post-merge shape (1202).

Two fixes: 1. Only set explicit attention_mask for "exclude" mode (text-only). For "include" and
  "checkpoint" modes, let the model construct its own mask internally after the vision merge.

2. Slice action logits from the END of the output sequence (not from prompt_len offset) when vision
  tensors are present, because the output sequence length differs from input_ids length after merge.

Crash was: IndexError: The shape of the mask [1305] at index 0 does not match the shape of the
  indexed tensor [1202] at index 0

## v0.76.2 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Waaconnection reads from .env via pydantic-settings
  ([#215](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/215),
  [`8bb176d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/8bb176d07dfb8fa3eef66ae85fc3185acb134d23))

Added WAA_HOST, WAA_KEY, WAA_USER to Settings in config.py. WAAConnection reads defaults from .env
  (via pydantic-settings) instead of raw os.environ, matching the rest of the codebase.

.env example: WAA_HOST=172.173.66.131 WAA_KEY=~/.ssh/waa_key WAA_USER=azureuser

## v0.76.1 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Align WAAConnection API with client usage
  ([#214](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/214),
  [`1a039f0`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/1a039f0ebb758863603943463afb7618ce32556b))

Client reported API mismatches (vm_ip positional, no .url property, no env var defaults, no SSH key
  config, no stop() method).

Changes: - vm_ip now optional with WAA_HOST env var fallback - waa_host kwarg alias for vm_ip
  (matches client naming) - waa_key / WAA_KEY env var for SSH key path - .url property returns
  http://localhost:{local_port} - .eval_url property returns http://localhost:{eval_local_port} -
  is_healthy() public method (non-blocking) - stop() alias for close() - SSH -i flag when ssh_key is
  set - Updated docstring with client's usage pattern

The client's pattern now works: waa = WAAConnection() # uses WAA_HOST env var waa.start() trainer =
  GRPOTrainer(config, on_before_collect=lambda t, e: waa.ensure_healthy()) trainer.train()
  waa.stop()

## v0.76.0 (2026-03-28)

### Features

- Trainer telemetry, UI-Venus prompt fix, --grounder-endpoint flag
  ([#213](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/213),
  [`7401262`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/7401262267d6588d723f7f82b293fafab2f74f6e))

Trainer telemetry (5 insertion points, all try/except wrapped): - train() start/end: model_name,
  num_steps, duration, reward_mean - _training_step(): step, task_id, reward_mean, loss, step_time -
  _collect_rollout(): task_id, num_steps, reward - _save_checkpoint(): step number

DemoExecutor UI-Venus prompt: - Updated _ground_click_http() to use identical prompt format as
  PlannerGrounderAgent._GROUNDER_PROMPT_BBOX for consistency - Model name hardcoded to
  UI-Venus-1.5-8B

Flywheel --grounder-endpoint flag: - Added to argparse, passed to both DemoExecutor and
  _run_live_episode - When set, PlannerGrounderAgent uses HTTP grounder provider

Tests: 12 new tests for DemoExecutor HTTP grounder path

README: Added UI-Venus serving + grounder endpoint docs

## v0.75.0 (2026-03-28)

### Features

- Demoexecutor supports HTTP grounding endpoint (UI-Venus)
  ([#211](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/211),
  [`6f9531b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/6f9531b401fe74107eb2da7fb0d3835c6117b22c))

Add grounder_endpoint parameter to DemoExecutor for dedicated grounding models (UI-Venus-1.5-8B,
  UI-TARS) via vLLM/Ollama. Uses the UI-Venus native bbox format [x1,y1,x2,y2] for much better click
  accuracy than gpt-4.1-mini's general VLM grounding.

Usage: executor = DemoExecutor( grounder_endpoint="http://gpu-box:8080",
  grounder_model="UI-Venus-1.5-8B", )

Falls back to VLM API grounding when no endpoint is set.

Also adds telemetry events for training, demo execution, corrections.

## v0.74.1 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Update enrichment tests for new instruction format
  ([#210](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/210),
  [`8ae0654`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/8ae06546b24d0583c12856c90a81be066656ed33))

_build_enriched_instruction now returns the description directly (e.g., "save button") instead of
  prefixing with "Click on" (e.g., "Click on save button"). Coordinates use "approximately at"
  format. Non-click actions with descriptions use the description.

32/32 enrichment tests pass.

## v0.74.0 (2026-03-28)

### Features

- Document DemoExecutor, standalone trainer, add telemetry events
  ([#209](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/209),
  [`3edba07`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/3edba0745b4ef97965155622aa765c918f3dd151))

README: - Add standalone GRPO trainer to Key Features (callback hooks, vision_loss_mode, constrained
  decoding) - Add DemoExecutor to Key Features (0.00 → 1.00 validated) - Add correction flywheel
  description - Add training install extra

CLAUDE.md: - Add DemoExecutor section with tiered execution docs - Add Standalone GRPO Trainer
  section with full API - Update architecture tree with new files

Telemetry: - Add 7 event functions: training_run, training_step, rollout_collected,
  checkpoint_saved, demo_execution, correction, demo_recorded - Instrument DemoExecutor with
  start/completed events + tier counts

## v0.73.0 (2026-03-28)

### Features

- Demoexecutor — tiered demo execution replacing planner-guided approach
  ([#208](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/208),
  [`80f1fc5`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/80f1fc50451609e7491aee177212da967c42264e))

The DemoGuidedAgent asked a VLM planner to interpret demo guidance appended to the prompt. The
  planner routinely ignored guidance, looped, hallucinated DONE, and required 9 special-case
  overrides.

DemoExecutor executes demo steps directly with tiered intelligence: - Tier 1 (deterministic):
  keyboard/type actions execute directly - Tier 2 (grounder-only): clicks use grounder to find
  elements - Tier 3 (planner recovery): only for unexpected states [future]

The planner becomes a recovery mechanism, not the primary executor.

For notepad-hello (5 steps): 4 are keyboard/type (deterministic), only 1 needs the grounder. For
  clear-browsing (3 steps): 2 keyboard, 1 click. The demo drives progress; the planner is no longer
  in the loop.

Phase 3 of the flywheel now uses DemoExecutor when a demo exists, falling back to the old
  planner-guided approach only when no demo is available.

## v0.72.9 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Override planner DONE hallucination on step 0
  ([#207](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/207),
  [`cfb8285`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/cfb8285934a412565f5dda32a5ad7ca2983420f5))

gpt-4.1-mini sees demo guidance describing completed steps and concludes the task is already done
  without taking any action. On notepad-hello, it claimed "Notepad is already open with Hello World
  typed" when the screen showed a clean desktop.

Fix: if DONE on step 0 with a demo library, force the first demo

action (e.g., Win+R for notepad, Ctrl+Shift+Delete for Chrome).

## v0.72.8 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Remove orphaned outputs reference, clean up test suite
  ([#206](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/206),
  [`9966783`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/9966783e42e0893e1d894ec0df55f352a4c96163))

Bug: `gen_len = outputs[0].shape[0] - ...` was outside the if/else

block — `outputs` only exists in the unconstrained path, crashing the constrained path with
  UnboundLocalError.

Test cleanup: removed source-code-grepping tests (brittle, test implementation not behavior). Kept
  31 tests that verify behavior: - Regex matching (valid/invalid inputs) - DFA quantifier limits -
  Outlines API contract (imports, dispatch types, image wrapper) - Generator cache sentinel logic -
  Task rotation (loading, explicit IDs, rotation coverage)

Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>


## v0.72.7 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Use list input format for Outlines multimodal generation
  ([#205](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/205),
  [`9c91a54`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/9c91a54c8c6d9fd9df88f00d381679c03256f7f7))

TransformersMultiModal.format_input is a singledispatch that only accepts `list` and `Chat` types. A
  `dict` raises TypeError.

Correct format: [prompt_text, outlines.Image(pil_image)] Wrong format: {"text": prompt, "images":
  [image]}

Also fixes PIL .format being dropped by .convert("RGB") — outlines.Image requires .format to be set.
  Restored after conversion.

New test: test_outlines_multimodal_input_format verifies: - list is a registered dispatch type (dict
  is NOT) - outlines.Image wraps PIL images correctly - This test would have caught both the dict
  and format bugs

36/36 tests pass in 0.10s.

## v0.72.6 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Use Outlines Generator API instead of logits_processor kwarg
  ([#204](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/204),
  [`aca70a2`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/aca70a2e6fecc65ef2284e9264325ba9a0c99ee6))

Outlines v1.2 does NOT work by passing a processor to model.generate(logits_processor=[...]). It
  uses its own Generator:

model = outlines.from_transformers(hf_model, hf_processor) gen = outlines.Generator(model,
  outlines.regex(pattern)) output = gen(prompt, max_new_tokens=512)

The Generator wraps the model and handles tokenization, constrained generation, and decoding
  internally. Prior approach compiled the processor successfully but it was never actually applied
  to generation.

Also fixes max_tokens → max_new_tokens (transformers kwarg name).

Tests (35, all pass in 0.09s): - test_outlines_api_imports: verifies from_transformers, regex,
  Generator - test_outlines_regex_compiles: verifies action regex compiles -
  test_outlines_generator_api_contract: verifies Generator and SteerableGenerator signatures match
  what the trainer calls - No slow model download — API contract checks only

## v0.72.5 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Unbounded regex quantifiers prevent Outlines DFA state explosion
  ([#203](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/203),
  [`55c3c5d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/55c3c5df6a50422bcfd666ca6721d6337a3a4d34))

* fix: use outlines v1.2 get_regex_logits_processor API

The outlines v1.2 API requires: 1. Wrapping the HF model+tokenizer in outlines.Transformers 2.
  Calling get_regex_logits_processor(None, wrapped, regex)

Prior code tried to construct OutlinesLogitsProcessor directly with a tokenizer= kwarg that doesn't
  exist in v1.2. The error was caught and silently fell back to unconstrained generation.

Tests now verify the ACTUAL API surface (import paths + factory function signature) instead of just
  checking class names exist. This would have caught all three prior Outlines bugs: - PR #197: wrong
  class name (RegexLogitsProcessor) - PR #201: wrong constructor (tokenizer= kwarg) - This PR: wrong
  API pattern (direct constructor vs factory)

33/33 tests pass with outlines 1.2.12 installed.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: use unbounded regex quantifiers to prevent DFA state explosion

Bounded quantifiers like {1,500} create counting DFA states that cross-product with every
  alternative in the regex. The Thought prefix alone created 1,500 states, exceeding Outlines' 2^31
  limit.

Changes: - [^\n]{1,500} → [^\n]+ (Thought prefix: 1 state vs 1,500) - [^"]{0,200} → [^"]* (TYPE
  text: 1 state vs 200) - \d{1,3} → \d+ (coordinates: 1 state vs 3)

max_new_tokens=512 provides the actual length limit. The DFA doesn't need to count characters.

New test: test_no_bounded_quantifiers_in_regex asserts no quantifier in the regex exceeds {N,10},
  preventing future regressions.

34/34 tests pass.

## v0.72.4 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Use outlines v1.2 get_regex_logits_processor API
  ([#202](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/202),
  [`39e94a8`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/39e94a89b6ae243ac0d726cc010b2e8844386a9e))

The outlines v1.2 API requires: 1. Wrapping the HF model+tokenizer in outlines.Transformers 2.

## v0.72.3 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Correct Outlines API import paths, add regression tests
  ([#201](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/201),
  [`62e74e0`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/62e74e096158d64f3616eaefb26188b4a83b139b))

The Outlines library changed its API across versions: - v0.1+: OutlinesLogitsProcessor (not
  RegexLogitsProcessor) - v0.1+: TransformerTokenizer (no 's') at outlines.TransformerTokenizer

The trainer now tries both import paths for version compatibility. The tokenizer is wrapped via
  TransformerTokenizer when available.

Tests: - test_outlines_import_paths_exist: verifies at least one processor class is importable from
  outlines.processors - test_outlines_tokenizer_wrapper_exists: checks TransformerTokenizer -
  test_task_rotation_not_stuck_on_first: regression test with 5 tasks verifying all appear in
  rotation (not just the first)

Also adds outlines>=0.1.0 to dev dependencies so tests run in CI without needing --extra training.

## v0.72.2 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Constrained decoding preserves chain-of-thought reasoning
  ([#200](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/200),
  [`d011b2f`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/d011b2fcab1a0489ef1e4d3b7d7bc362a6cd64d5))

The Thought/Action format from SYSTEM_PROMPT is now enforced by the constrained decoding regex:

Thought: <up to 500 chars of reasoning>

Action: CLICK(x=0.50, y=0.30)

This gives the model a reasoning budget while guaranteeing parseable output. Prior regex had no
  prefix (model couldn't reason) or used (.|\n)* (Outlines couldn't compile the DFA).

Also exposes _ACTION_RE (action-only regex) for use by the parser.

Tests updated: 30 pass (was 21).

## v0.72.1 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Constrained decoding cache bug, task rotation, add trainer tests
  ([#199](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/199),
  [`4ec7d51`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/4ec7d5174e1c8420d436af5cc6810b211a85de61))

Constrained decoding: - Remove (.|\n)* prefix from action regex — Outlines can't compile it into a
  DFA efficiently. Model must output action directly. - Fix cache sentinel: use False for failure
  (not []) so subsequent calls correctly return None instead of empty logits_processor list. Prior
  bug: [] cached as "success" → model generated unconstrained. - Upgrade warning to error level for
  visibility.

Task rotation: - Fix _load_task_configs: check `not task_ids` once BEFORE the loop (was checking
  inside loop — only first task ever appended).

Tests (21 new): - TestActionRegex: 8 valid actions match, 6 invalid texts rejected -
  TestConstrainedDecodingCache: sentinel logic, regression for [] bug - TestTaskRotation: all tasks
  loaded, explicit ids preserved, rotation

## v0.72.0 (2026-03-28)

### Features

- Add callback hooks to standalone GRPO trainer
  ([#198](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/198),
  [`28b0193`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/28b0193fea10c4b1c3a08142d48982a110bb1a44))

Four optional callback hooks eliminate the need for monkey-patching:

- on_model_loaded(model, processor): Custom model setup (gradient checkpointing on specific
  submodules, hook attachment) - on_before_collect(task_id, env): WAA health checks, tunnel
  verification, task-specific setup before rollout collection - on_rollout_complete(rollout, index):
  Per-rollout W&B logging, screenshot/thought capture - on_step_complete(step, rollouts, metrics):
  Per-step W&B logging, early stopping, custom evaluation

All callbacks are keyword-only with None defaults (no-op). Eliminates 3 of 6 monkey-patches reported
  by customer.

## v0.71.3 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Eval infra, forced keyboard override, Outlines constrained decoding
  ([#197](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/197),
  [`257bc7f`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/257bc7f2f3595ed9d350ac8a482efdf805302a05))

* fix: per-step milestone tracking, forced keyboard override, eval infra

Evaluation infrastructure: - Per-step milestone high-water mark: milestones checked after each step,
  once passed they stay passed. Fixes transient states (open dialogs) being missed by
  end-of-episode-only evaluation. - evaluate_checks_local() fallback: when /evaluate endpoint is
  down, uses task config's own command/screenshot checks via /execute_windows - iptables retry loop
  in start_with_evaluate.sh: ensures port 5050 exemption persists even if DNAT rule is (re)applied
  later

Anti-loop forced override: - After 6 consecutive identical actions (planner ignoring warnings),
  bypasses planner entirely and emits first keyboard shortcut from demo guidance (e.g.,
  Ctrl+Shift+Delete). This breaks click loops where the grounder places clicks incorrectly.

Task setup fixes: - Chrome popup: registry policies, First Run sentinel, launch flags - Single-line
  PowerShell commands (fixes YAML escaping for /execute_windows) - Redesigned milestones: combined
  settings/dialog check, evidence-based

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: remove Alt+F4 from demo, add Outlines constrained decoding

Demo fix: - Remove step 4 (Alt+F4 close Chrome) from clear-browsing-data demo. Alt+F4 on desktop
  triggers Windows Shutdown dialog when Chrome loses focus. The task goal is clearing data, not
  closing Chrome. - Updated step 2 description to include "Delete from this device" button text
  (newer Chrome versions changed the label).

Constrained decoding (GRPO trainer): - Add `constrained_decoding` config flag (default False) - When
  enabled, uses Outlines RegexLogitsProcessor to force model output to match the action format regex
  (CLICK/TYPE/WAIT/DONE). Eliminates 5-15% of rollouts wasted on unparseable output. - Allows
  free-form Thought prefix before the action. - DFA compilation cached after first call (~2s
  one-time cost). - Graceful fallback if outlines not installed. - Added outlines>=0.1.0 to training
  optional dependencies.

## v0.71.2 (2026-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

- Demo guidance plan overview, anti-loop recovery, GRPO trainer fixes
  ([#196](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/196),
  [`1a8ad93`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/1a8ad939368a14a85d6ba1c9d921b3e065dead77))

Flywheel guidance: - Add get_plan_overview() to DemoLibrary: injects full demo strategy (all steps +
  keyboard shortcuts) instead of one-step-at-a-time guidance - Fix _build_enriched_instruction()
  producing "Click on Double-click..." and omit fake coordinates from manual demos - DemoGuidedAgent
  sets demo_guidance on base agent for anti-loop recovery

Anti-loop recovery: - New _ANTI_LOOP_WARNING_WITH_DEMO directs planner to use keyboard shortcuts
  from demo strategy when stuck clicking unresponsive elements - _check_action_loop() uses
  demo-aware warning when demo_guidance is set

Chrome popup suppression: - Add registry policy key disabling SpeedComparison in task setup - Launch
  Chrome with --no-first-run --disable-features=SpeedComparison - Send Escape to dismiss residual
  popups before closing Chrome

GRPO trainer (standalone): - Add vision_loss_mode config: "exclude" (default), "include",
  "checkpoint" with warning log when vision tensors stripped from loss computation - Add VRAM
  recommendations for max_new_tokens (L40S: 512, A100: 1024-2048) - Add truncation warning when
  output hits max_new_tokens without action - Fix float parsing crash on CLICK(x=..., y=...) literal
  dots

Validated: flywheel 0.00 -> 0.25 (+0.25) on clear-browsing-data-chrome

## v0.71.1 (2026-03-27)

### Bug Fixes

- Skip visual alignment when demo has no real screenshots
  ([`11513c1`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/11513c167ed33ea29fe31a254f7ed54279ffc804))

Placeholder screenshots (19 bytes) cause pHash to produce garbage distances → low confidence →
  adaptive disabling kicks in after 3 steps → guidance disabled for entire episode. Manual demos
  with descriptions but no screenshots need sequential alignment to work.

## v0.71.0 (2026-03-26)

### Features

- Add desktop cleanup, manual demo tools, and fix trainer OOM bugs
  ([#195](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/195),
  [`57a8094`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/57a80943c2a696d68e6e8560f1f6d24e8b054e8c))

- Add clean_desktop() to WAADirect to kill known distracting apps between episodes, preventing stale
  desktop state from leaking across phases - Handle close_all config entry type in
  WAADirect.setup_task() - Create manual notepad-hello demo (DemoLibrary-compatible, no screenshots)
  - Add scripts/create_manual_demo.py CLI for authoring demos from text specs - Fix vision tensor
  exclusion in GRPO loss computation (OOM on L40S) - Add try/except for float parsing in
  parse_vlm_output_to_action - Lower max_new_tokens default from 2048 to 512 (prevents OOM,
  sufficient for Thought+Action format)

## v0.70.2 (2026-03-26)

### Bug Fixes

- Switch distillation collection to WAADirect for reliable task setup
  ([#194](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/194),
  [`fa1a9c4`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/fa1a9c4a9fc830315b99f655228e03e7aa4cd434))

Replace RLEnvironment + WAALiveAdapter with WAADirect in the distillation data collection script.
  The adapter layer fails on custom YAML task IDs and doesn't reset the environment properly.

Key changes: - Load task configs from --task-dir (YAML/JSON files) via TaskConfig.from_dir() - Use
  WAADirect.setup_task(task_config.to_waa_config()) for environment reset - Use
  WAADirect.screenshot() and execute_action() instead of env.step() - Evaluate via
  evaluate_milestones_screenshot() on fresh post-episode screenshot - Fix Anthropic API call: always
  use max_tokens (not max_completion_tokens) - Add --eval-model flag for milestone VLM evaluation
  model - Add --task-dir as required arg (replaces server-side task discovery)

Kept unchanged: TeacherAgent, PlannerTrajectoryLogger (keep_failed=True), CostTracker, resume
  support, graceful shutdown handling.

## v0.70.0 (2026-03-24)

### Features

- Add --task-ids, --max-steps-per-episode, --max-new-tokens to standalone GRPO CLI
  ([`6ecd136`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/6ecd1369fd834fce34e8c7f1f43a5d1f358aeba0))

Without --task-ids, the trainer cycles through ALL tasks in --task-dir including hard ones
  (calc-formula) that base models can't complete. Now you can filter: --task-ids
  custom-notepad-hello

## v0.69.1 (2026-03-24)

### Bug Fixes

- Align standalone GRPO with WAA API format and add retry logic
  ([#193](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/193),
  [`43cac1c`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/43cac1ca9708dbfaa858c89fdea2b3af40df5ebb))

The standalone GRPO trainer produced zero rewards due to two API format bugs in WAADirect:

1. screenshot() tried resp.json() expecting base64-encoded JSON, but WAA's /screenshot returns raw
  PNG bytes via Flask's send_file(). Fixed to use resp.content (matching WAALiveAdapter).

2. execute_action() wrapped commands in `python -c "..."`, but WAA's /execute_windows uses exec()
  directly -- the wrapper caused SyntaxError inside the VM. Fixed to send bare Python statements
  (matching WAALiveAdapter._build_pixel_command).

Additional improvements: - Add probe() method for structured health checking - Add screenshot retry
  logic (3 attempts with 2s delay) - Add double_click, right_click, scroll action types - Fix type
  action to click target first then type (match WAALiveAdapter) - Add pre-rollout health check in
  trainer._collect_group() - Handle empty rollouts gracefully in training loop - Fix train script to
  bypass openadapt_evals/__init__.py eager imports (open_clip -> numpy ABI crash in minimal training
  environments)

## v0.69.0 (2026-03-24)

### Features

- Add comprehensive API and infrastructure cost tracking
  ([#192](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/192),
  [`43021a7`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/43021a74ede54200df9e87d83dc32bcf48d0455b))

Add a centralized, thread-safe CostTracker that records token usage from every VLM/LLM API call and
  infrastructure time (GPU/VM hours).

The tracker is integrated at the vlm_call() level so all 15+ callers automatically get cost tracking
  without any changes. Key integration points have cost_label tags for per-component breakdown
  (planner, grounder, vlm_judge, demo_verify, etc.).

- New openadapt_evals/cost_tracker.py with global singleton, pricing tables, JSON persistence, and
  human-readable summary output - vlm.py extracts response.usage tokens from both OpenAI and
  Anthropic responses and reports to the tracker - 18 unit tests covering pricing lookup,
  aggregation, thread safety, persistence, and vlm.py integration

## v0.68.0 (2026-03-23)

### Features

- Add standalone GRPO trainer with WAADirect (no openadapt-ml dependency)
  ([#191](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/191),
  [`ba049f7`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/ba049f74f82bb3034465cf4368f4808f22b5f7e9))

Self-contained GRPO training package that eliminates the openadapt-ml dependency for RL training.
  Uses direct HTTP calls to WAA Flask server (WAADirect) instead of the WAALiveAdapter +
  RLEnvironment stack, removing version coupling and adapter indirection.

Package structure (695 LOC total): - config.py: TrainingConfig dataclass - waa_direct.py: WAADirect
  HTTP client (screenshot/click/type/key) - prompt.py: SYSTEM_PROMPT + build_agent_messages +
  parse_vlm_output_to_action - reward.py: compute_group_advantages + evaluate_milestones_screenshot
  - model_loader.py: load_model_and_processor (HF + PEFT) - trainer.py: GRPOTrainer with rollout
  collection + training loop

Key design decisions: - ZERO openadapt-ml imports (self-contained, will migrate later) -
  max_new_tokens=2048 default (100 was catastrophically low) - Multi-format parser (Thought/Action,
  bare DSL, JSON) - Fresh screenshot for evaluation (not cached) - Per-step backward to avoid OOM on
  long trajectories - VLM judge via OpenAI API for milestone evaluation

## v0.67.0 (2026-03-23)

### Features

- Add SGLang local model serving to comparison framework
  ([#190](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/190),
  [`6454bc9`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/6454bc9057bf5bea9abd368ae7b0819e85c0a5b2))

Add support for serving models via SGLang on remote GPU hosts, enabling comparison of API models
  (GPT, Claude) against locally-served models (e.g. Qwen3.5-9B) that vLLM cannot serve.

Key changes: - New scripts/sglang_server.py: SGLangServerManager handles full lifecycle (SSH
  install, server start, readiness polling, SSH tunnel, cleanup) - Extended ModelConfig with
  provider="sglang", serve config, max_new_tokens - New --gpu-host and --ssh-key CLI flags
  (optional; sglang models skipped without --gpu-host) - SGLang server auto-starts per model,
  tunneled as OpenAI-compatible API - Environment variables (OPENAI_BASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY)
  saved/restored between models so API models remain unaffected - New
  example_comparisons/unified_agents.yaml demonstrating mixed config

## v0.66.0 (2026-03-23)

### Features

- Add GPU instance lifecycle CLI for model serving
  ([#189](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/189),
  [`ce379be`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/ce379be06ef18c7308c2258905eb3215abfe03d5))

Add `openadapt-gpu` CLI that automates the full GPU experiment workflow: launch EC2 instance,
  install inference engine (SGLang/vLLM), serve model, set up SSH tunnel, and terminate. Replaces 9
  manual steps with one command.

Commands: launch, status, terminate, serve, run-comparison, ssh, logs.

State persisted to ~/.openadapt/gpu_state.json so terminate always works even when SSH is broken
  (uses EC2 API directly).

## v0.64.1 (2026-03-23)

### Bug Fixes

- Address flywheel regression bugs (VM reset, demo validation, alignment)
  ([#187](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/187),
  [`e2f0928`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e2f0928b93817fe32a385ead8d27ed596df91378))

Fix five interacting bugs that caused the demo guidance regression (score 1.0 -> 0.5) on the
  notepad-hello task:

1. Add VM reset between phases: Phase 1 artifacts (open windows, typed text) leaked into Phase 3.
  New --reset-between-phases flag (default True) re-runs task setup commands to restore a clean
  desktop.

2. Validate demo quality: Before using a demo, check for placeholder screenshots, identical
  screenshots across steps, and doubled action text (e.g., "Hello WorldHello world") indicating a
  failed run. Warnings are logged and saved to demo_quality_warnings.json.

3. Force sequential alignment for short demos: When the demo has < 5 steps, disable pHash visual
  alignment (which cannot distinguish similar desktop screenshots) and use sequential step index
  instead. New use_visual_alignment parameter threaded through DemoGuidedAgent.

4. Remove step counts from guidance prompt: The "step N/N" prefix in DEMONSTRATION GUIDANCE caused
  the planner to interpret "last step" as "task is done" and prematurely signal DONE. Guidance now
  describes WHAT to do without revealing position in the demo sequence.

5. Evaluate on fresh screenshot: evaluate_dense() now takes a fresh screenshot from the adapter
  instead of using a cached one from a previous step/phase. Falls back to cached on failure.

Also adds task navigational ambiguity analysis identifying tasks where demo guidance should help
  most (high: Chrome clear data, VLC preferences, LibreOffice formatting; low: notepad, desktop
  folder, VS Code replace).

## v0.64.0 (2026-03-23)

### Features

- Automate full VM lifecycle in correction flywheel script
  ([#186](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/186),
  [`748534b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/748534bffd3b024cd587aec22abc2697f511af6f))

Integrate all manual infrastructure steps so the flywheel runs end-to-end deterministically with a
  single command:

python scripts/run_correction_flywheel.py \ --task-config
  example_tasks/clear-browsing-data-chrome.yaml \ --demo-dir ./demos --manage-vm --setup-tunnels

New infrastructure functions (inline, matching azure_vm.py patterns): - start_vm / get_vm_ip /
  get_vm_state / wait_for_ssh / deallocate_vm - start_container (docker start or docker run with
  correct flags) - apply_iptables_fix (exempt port 5050 from DNAT, idempotent) - setup_tunnels (kill
  stale, create SSH tunnels for 5001/5050/8006) - setup_eval_proxy (socat bridge for evaluate
  server) - wait_for_waa (poll /probe through tunnel)

Design decisions: - --manage-vm flag: opt-in VM start/deallocate lifecycle - --setup-tunnels flag:
  opt-in tunnel setup with port cleanup - --baseline-model / --guided-model: use different planner
  models for Phase 1 vs Phase 3 (e.g., gpt-4o-mini baseline to ensure failure) - VM deallocate in
  try/finally (always runs, even on error) - Phase errors are caught individually; report always
  generated with partial results - All operations are idempotent (safe to re-run) - --mock mode
  unchanged (no VM management needed)

  ([#184](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/184),
  [`8d4f595`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/8d4f59526f2b574f2db7893318d68cc33ca1873e))

- Add score distribution bar chart with color-coded bars (green >0.75, yellow 0.25-0.75, red <0.25)
  for per-task score visualization - Add failure analysis section with grouped failure types and
  example episode IDs for each failure mode - Add interactive inline step viewer: click episode
  table rows to expand and see step-by-step screenshots without scrolling to a separate section -
  Embed screenshots as base64 data URIs so the HTML report is fully self-contained with no external
  file references - Add percentile statistics: median score, P25/P75 breakdowns, median time, and
  time distribution - Add side-by-side comparison stat cards (Run A vs Run B) with delta
  highlighting (green = improved, red = regressed) and unified task-level diff table showing score
  and step deltas - Add "Copy as Markdown" button that formats the summary as a Markdown table for
  pasting into Slack/GitHub - Improve table sorting with sort direction indicators and data-sort
  attributes for correct numeric sorting - Add hover effects on cards (lift + shadow), table rows,

## v0.61.0 (2026-03-22)

### Features

- Add checkpoint evaluation script for GRPO before/after comparison
  ([#183](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/183),
  [`075472b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/075472bd3b8dd4bb1eb41fb2aaa13f64068ba77c))

Evaluates LoRA checkpoints against WAA tasks with milestone scoring. Same model loading, prompt, and
  action parsing as the GRPO trainer. Supports baseline vs checkpoint comparison via TraceAnalyzer.

## v0.60.0 (2026-03-22)

### Features

- Add evaluate_milestones_screenshot for client-side reward computation
  ([#182](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/182),
  [`0a615de`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/0a615de7e94c9d82a85ea82f978bbe350e85d722))

Standalone function that evaluates milestone rewards from a screenshot using VLM checks only,
  without requiring a WAA server. This enables the GRPO trainer to compute rewards client-side
  during rollouts.

## v0.59.3 (2026-03-22)

### Bug Fixes

- Add vm_ip and port to MockEnv in evaluate_server.py
  ([#181](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/181),
  [`ee7eb8c`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/ee7eb8c1237173483f347a74fb07f6a8b3bc51c2))

WAA getter modules access env.vm_ip to make HTTP calls to the Windows VM. The MockEnv class in
  evaluate_server.py was missing this attribute, causing getters to crash with AttributeError during
  evaluation.

Add vm_ip (default "172.30.0.2") and port (default 5000) to match the MockEnv in
  evaluate_endpoint.py and the QEMU guest address used by the PythonController.

## v0.59.2 (2026-03-22)

### Bug Fixes

- Exempt port 5050 from DNAT so evaluate server is reachable
  ([`b379290`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/b3792907ed759dc1c1b1539e4bd6e1510baabaca))

The DNAT rule in the container forwards ALL TCP ports to the Windows VM at 172.30.0.2, except a few
  (5700, 5900, 7100, 8006, 8004). Port 5050 was NOT exempted, so connections to the evaluate server
  were forwarded to the Windows VM instead of the container's Flask app.

This was the root cause of every evaluate endpoint timeout/disconnect in this session. The evaluate
  server was running fine — traffic just never reached it.

## v0.59.1 (2026-03-22)

### Bug Fixes

- Add shell=True to launch handler for Windows app resolution
  ([`1f5eb21`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/1f5eb211c10e1318f9ed04f64b7d46ede1a75129))

subprocess.Popen('calc') without shell=True fails on Windows because CreateProcessW doesn't search
  PATH the same way cmd.exe does. WAA's native /setup/launch endpoint hardcodes shell=True which is
  why it works. Match that behavior.

## v0.59.0 (2026-03-21)

### Features

- Add OpenAI embedding-based alignment strategy for DemoLibrary
  ([#179](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/179),
  [`006688c`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/006688c7ead71254ed84264ffac9e6ad657bfdfd))

Add OpenAIEmbeddingAlignment class that implements the AlignmentStrategy protocol using OpenAI's VLM
  (gpt-4o-mini) for screenshot description and text-embedding-3-small for semantic embedding. This
  provides a cloud-based alternative to local CLIP models for demo step alignment.

Key changes: - OpenAIEmbeddingAlignment: two-step pipeline (VLM describe + embed) with cosine
  similarity matching against pre-computed demo embeddings - create_alignment_strategy() factory:
  accepts string names ("phash", "clip", "hybrid", "openai") for easy construction - DemoLibrary
  constructor now accepts string alignment_strategy names with automatic fallback to pHash on
  failure - enrich_demo() pre-computes OpenAI embeddings when strategy is "openai" - Embeddings
  persist to demo.json as plain lists for serialization - Pure-Python cosine similarity fallback
  when numpy is not installed

Cost: ~$0.001 per screenshot (~$0.06 for 61 demos total).

PowerShell process checks via /execute_windows timeout when the WAA Flask server is slow. VLM
  screenshot checks work reliably (proven with confidence 1.00). Simpler, more robust, no server
  dependency.

  [`b017b6e`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/b017b6e52071b52e8f7f25f3a881cd6845bd2538))

* fix: skip verify_apps, close_all, activate_window in lightweight mode

These setup entry types hang (120s timeout), crash the WAA server, or are unnecessary for task
  execution. In lightweight mode (the default), they are now skipped entirely — both the verify_apps
  step injected from related_apps and any close_all / activate_window entries in the task config
  array. Each skipped entry is recorded with status "skipped" in _last_setup_results for
  auditability.

* fix: replace AutoModelForVision2Seq with AutoModelForImageTextToText for transformers 5.x

AutoModelForVision2Seq was removed in transformers 5.x (shipped on AWS DL AMI). Use

### Features

- Add monotonic progress bias and pluggable alignment strategy to DemoLibrary
  ([#176](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/176),

Add three major improvements to demo-guided alignment:

1. Pluggable AlignmentStrategy protocol with PHashAlignmentStrategy (default), CLIPAlignmentStrategy
  (optional, requires open-clip-torch), and HybridAlignmentStrategy (pHash top-K + CLIP re-rank).

2. Monotonic progress bias that penalizes backward jumps in step matching to prevent oscillating
  alignment. Configurable via backward_penalty parameter (default 0.3).

3. Adaptive guidance disabling that turns off demo guidance after N consecutive low-confidence
  alignments (default 3 at threshold 0.3), preventing the "demo hurts" failure mode.

Also adds AlignmentTraceEntry dataclass for post-hoc analysis of alignment quality, stored in
  DemoGuidance.metadata["alignment_trace"].

DemoGuidedAgent now calls reset_alignment_state() on task change and episode reset to clear
  monotonic progress tracking.

All 77 tests pass (20 existing + 31 enrichment + 26 new).

## v0.55.0 (2026-03-21)

### Features

- Add lightweight mode to WAALiveAdapter (default on)
  ([`dfa128e`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/dfa128e11f5d1a7e1c8d082e1f22ed1bc054ab50))

Lightweight mode skips all cleanup, notification dismissal, and post-setup focus checks during
  reset(). Just runs task setup commands, takes a screenshot, and lets the agent go.

The agent handles popups autonomously — proven more reliable than our cleanup code which frequently
  crashed the WAA Flask server.

Legacy mode (lightweight=False) preserved for backward compatibility.

GPT-5.4-mini returns 400 Bad Request when max_tokens is used. These models require
  max_completion_tokens instead. Auto-detect based on model name prefix.

### Features

- Add visual similarity alignment to DemoLibrary
  ([#174](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/174),
  [`e773d85`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e773d855fddd0b30a79e352299f01cff4850f463))

Replace sequential step-index alignment with perceptual hash (pHash) visual similarity matching.
  When align_step() receives a current screenshot, it compares it against all demo screenshots using
  pHash and returns guidance for the most visually similar demo step. This fixes misalignment when
  the agent takes a different number of steps than the demo.

Key changes: - Add _find_closest_demo_step() using imagehash.phash comparison - Cache demo
  screenshot pHashes on DemoStep._phash (computed once) - Add use_visual_alignment parameter
  (default True) for opt-out - Add visual_alignment_used and visual_distance to DemoGuidance - Strip
  _phash from JSON serialization via _demo_to_dict helper - Falls back to sequential alignment when
  no screenshot provided, visual alignment disabled, or imagehash not installed - 20 new tests
  covering matching, fallback, caching, confidence, edge cases, and resolution normalization
  interaction

## v0.53.0 (2026-03-21)

### Bug Fixes

- Add retry logic and configurable timeout for evaluation endpoint
  ([#173](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/173),
  [`57dd53b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/57dd53b48998071664a50ac8e918126a5ae83a3d))

The /evaluate endpoint frequently times out because WAA evaluators need to reach the Windows VM at
  172.30.0.2 to run getters/metrics. The previous 90s general timeout was shared with all requests
  and insufficient for evaluation.

Changes: - Add evaluate_timeout (default 180s) separate from general timeout (90s) - Add
  evaluate_retries (default 3) with exponential backoff on timeout/connection errors - Add
  evaluate_retry_base_delay (default 5s) for configurable backoff - Extract _evaluate_request()
  helper that encapsulates retry logic - Only retry on Timeout and ConnectionError (not HTTP 404/500
  which are not transient) - Existing tests updated to use evaluate_retries=1 for speed - Three new
  tests: retry on timeout, success after retry, evaluate_timeout usage

- Make task instruction more prominent in planner prompt
  ([#171](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/171),
  [`172f1ee`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/172f1ee40c8d64c6e0f65ec3992383d216911a54))

The planner was ignoring task instructions and defaulting to clicking visible desktop icons (Chrome)
  regardless of the task. Three fixes:

1. Task instruction in prominent delimited block at TOP of prompt: "=== YOUR TASK (follow this
  EXACTLY) ===" 2. Anti-distraction directive: "Do NOT open applications the task does not ask you
  to use" 3. App launch guidance: "Use Start menu or Win+R if the app isn't on the desktop"

Also adds diagnostic logging of task instruction on every planner call.

## v0.52.0 (2026-03-21)

### Features

- Update default planner model to gpt-5.4
  ([#170](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/170),
  [`3e56272`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/3e562726dca3079abf7ba31379005144272046f4))

* fix: skip close_all and notification cleanup by default

The close_all PowerShell command (Get-Process | CloseMainWindow) and notification cleanup (taskkill
  OneDrive) crash the WAA Flask server, making it unresponsive for the rest of the run. This
  happened on every test run.

Now these only run when clean_desktop=True is explicitly set. Default behavior skips them entirely —
  the task runs against whatever state the desktop is in, which is more reliable than crashing the
  server trying to clean up.

* feat: update default planner model to gpt-5.4

Update the OpenAI default model in ApiAgent from gpt-5.1 to gpt-5.4 for higher-quality planning and
  reasoning in both the main agent and the WAA deploy copy.

## v0.51.1 (2026-03-21)

### Bug Fixes

- Reduce cleanup timeouts and make verify_apps non-fatal
  ([#169](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/169),
  [`4094c68`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/4094c682dfc1d1a8cc25d60918c1396e06d66e4f))

The notification cleanup (taskkill OneDrive, etc.) and close_all commands were causing the WAA Flask
  server to hang or crash. The 15s HTTP timeout per cleanup command × 4 commands = 60s of blocking
  before task execution even starts.

Changes: - Reduce notification cleanup timeout from 15s to 5s - Reduce close_all timeout from 30s to
  10s - Make verify_apps and activate_window timeouts non-fatal (warn instead of crash) — a timeout
  checking if an app exists shouldn't prevent the task from running

  [`8e825dd`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/8e825ddea71590f4b75dc1c4c6de806fdaa2eff6))

Add detailed usage documentation for all major features added in PRs #134-#165:

- Docker/WAA Container: --cap-add NET_ADMIN requirement, full docker run command, boot timeline,
  port reference - Full Evaluation Runner (run_full_eval.py): all flags with defaults, example
  commands for smoke test, resume, parallel, HTTP grounder - Distillation Pipeline: two-step

- Document --cap-add NET_ADMIN as required for WAA container networking
  ([#165](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/165),

* feat: add GPT-5.4 distillation pipeline for Qwen3.5-9B fine-tuning

Add two scripts implementing Phase 1 of the distillation pipeline:

- collect_distillation_data.py: Runs a frontier model (GPT-5.4, Claude, etc.) as teacher on WAA
  tasks, saving successful (screenshot, action) trajectories as SFT-ready JSONL + PNGs via
  PlannerTrajectoryLogger. Supports resume, cost tracking, task filtering, and --max-tasks for
  cost-limited testing.

- finetune_distilled.py: Fine-tunes a student VLM (Qwen3.5-9B or any HuggingFace model) with LoRA on
  the collected trajectories using TRL SFTTrainer. Supports Unsloth for 2x speedup, 4-bit
  quantization, and a --mock mode that validates the full pipeline without GPU.

* docs: document --cap-add NET_ADMIN as required for WAA container networking

Without this flag, the container falls back to user-mode networking and cannot reach the Windows
  QEMU guest at 20.20.20.21. Port 5050 (evaluate server on Linux side) works fine, making the
  failure confusing — but port 5000 (WAA Flask server inside Windows) is unreachable.

### Features

- Add VLM element description enrichment and resolution normalization to DemoLibrary
  ([#168](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/168),
  [`5b91def`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/5b91defd8d71b34775ed3b143d7abb5b6bb6847b))

Add VLM-based element description enrichment so demo guidance returns human-readable instructions
  like 'Click on three-dot menu button in Chrome toolbar at approximately (0.960, 0.066)' instead of
  raw 'CLICK(0.960, 0.066)' coordinates.

Changes: - Add description field to DemoStep for VLM-generated element labels - Add enrich_demo()
  method: crops region around click point, sends full screenshot + crop to VLM, stores element
  description per step - Add descriptions and auto_enrich params to add_demo() for providing
  descriptions at creation time or auto-enriching via VLM - Add resolution param to add_demo() and
  current_resolution to align_step() for proportional coordinate normalization across different
  screen sizes - Build enriched instructions via _build_enriched_instruction() that uses
  descriptions when available, falls back to raw coordinates - Graceful degradation: VLM failures
  log warnings but do not break the pipeline; Pillow import is lazy; enrichment is fully optional -
  31 new tests covering all features including backward compatibility

## v0.50.1 (2026-03-20)

### Bug Fixes

- Use absolute path /entry.sh in Dockerfile CMD and document install_apps
  ([#162](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/162),
  [`6e408d4`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/6e408d4fd37440bb78e42db828093b77fbb4d500))

The Dockerfile CMD used ./entry.sh (relative path) which fails when start_with_evaluate.sh runs exec
  "$@" — the working directory doesn't contain entry.sh. This caused Windows to never boot, leaving
  port 5000 down while port 5050 (evaluate server) worked fine.

This was the root cause of the customer's "WAA server not starting" bug — the same issue on both our
  VM and theirs.

Also adds documentation comment to install_apps handler explaining it's a safety net for edge cases,
  not needed for standard WAA tasks (all apps are pre-installed in the Docker image).

## v0.50.0 (2026-03-20)

### Features

- Add demo-guided execution and self-verification for 99% accuracy target
  ([#161](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/161),
  [`d8d2fa5`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/d8d2fa58c03890921f0ebe5f16542b1c32e4ba04))

Add DemoLibrary (directory-based demo storage with sequential step alignment), DemoGuidedAgent
  (wraps any BenchmarkAgent with demo guidance injection and optional VLM-based self-verification),
  and PlannerGrounderAgent integration (demo_guidance attribute + prompt slot).

Key components: - DemoLibrary: stores demos as JSON + screenshots on disk, provides align_step() for
  sequential guidance with graceful fallback - DemoGuidedAgent: augments task instructions with demo
  context, runs post-action verification comparing actual vs expected screenshots -
  PlannerGrounderAgent: new demo_guidance attribute and {demo_guidance} template slot in planner
  prompt (purely additive, no behavior change when empty)

- Add full evaluation runner with resume support and pool integration
  ([#160](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/160),
  [`ada912d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/ada912d8a7c14532cc26f3b8a62ba3b2769e3996))

Implement _run_external_agent in pool.py to support PlannerGrounderAgent and other external agents
  across pool VMs via SSH tunnels. Create run_full_eval.py script for robust unattended WAA
  evaluation runs with incremental JSONL checkpointing, per-task error isolation, exponential
  backoff retry on server drops, --resume to continue interrupted runs, --dry-run mode,
  --save-screenshots, progress display with ETA, and --parallel N for distributed pool execution.

- Implement install_apps handler via winget for WAA task setup
  ([#159](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/159),
  [`233295e`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/233295e454a310e323eefad6dfcf1656bd4f835c))

Replace the warning-only stub in _config_entry_to_command with a working implementation that
  installs apps using Windows Package Manager (winget).

- Map 16 common app names (chrome, firefox, libreoffice, vlc, vscode, 7zip, notepad++, gimp, obs,
  audacity, paint.net) to winget package IDs - Normalize app names (hyphens/spaces to underscores)
  to handle WAA config inconsistencies (e.g. "libreoffice-calc" vs "libreoffice_calc") - Deduplicate
  installs (e.g. libreoffice_calc + libreoffice_writer both map to
  TheDocumentFoundation.LibreOffice) - For unknown apps, fall back to winget search and install
  first match - Collect failures without crashing — each app install is independent - Use 600s HTTP
  timeout for install_apps (vs 120s default) since winget installs can take several minutes - Accept
  both success (rc=0) and already-installed (rc=-1978335189)

## v0.48.5 (2026-03-20)

### Bug Fixes

- Add all missing WAA config entry type handlers
  ([#157](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/157),
  [`a5fec25`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/a5fec255fe248c5620c7c6630345b627c6d1102d))

Proactively adds handlers for every config type defined in the WAA server to prevent further
  customer bug reports:

- command: alias for execute (some tasks use this) - close_all: graceful then force-kill all app
  windows - create_folder: os.makedirs with exist_ok - create_file: create file with initial content
  - clear_task_files: remove task workspace temp files - install_apps: logged warning (too complex
  for client-side)

Audited all 154 WAA task JSONs to ensure complete coverage. The only remaining unhandled type is
  install_apps which requires WAA's server-side app download registry.

## v0.48.4 (2026-03-20)

### Bug Fixes

- Add update_browse_history handler and fix verify_apps crash
  ([#156](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/156),
  [`56e1b63`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/56e1b6383c35781977407dfad2b5ab0d9a1f0d7a))

Bug 6a: The YouTube task config uses "update_browse_history" to pre-populate Chrome's history.sqlite
  with URLs before the agent runs. This was being skipped as an unknown type. Now translates to a
  Python script that kills Chrome, finds the History DB, and INSERTs entries with proper Chrome
  timestamps (microseconds since 1601-01-01).

Bug 6b: verify_apps crashed with "AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'replace'" because
  the WAA task JSON uses "app" (list) but the handler expected "apps" (string). Now handles both
  parameter names and properly serializes the list with repr().

## v0.48.3 (2026-03-20)

### Bug Fixes

- Restore optional-dependencies removed by PR #151
  ([#155](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/155),
  [`7f57eda`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/7f57eda3f2fff10c69a03ec9732cf6cedd2cf935))

PR #151 (docs: add openadapt-ml migration analysis report) accidentally deleted the entire
  [project.optional-dependencies] section and the openadapt-ml editable source from pyproject.toml.
  This broke CI because `uv sync --extra dev --no-sources` fails when the dev extra doesn't exist.
  The PR was merged despite failing CI because enforce_admins is disabled on branch protection.

Restores all optional-dependency groups (dev, waa, azure, aws, retrieval, viewer, wandb, training,
  verl, all, test) and the openadapt-ml editable source. Regenerates uv.lock with --no-sources to
  match CI resolution.

## v0.48.2 (2026-03-20)

### Bug Fixes

- Add strict mode to prevent silent fallback degradation during benchmarking
  ([#154](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/154),
  [`62934ab`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/62934ab54cbec4cadbbf6ad2ba691814d5fa732f))

When strict=True, components that previously degraded silently now raise errors instead, ensuring
  benchmarking/training runs use the intended system configuration (e.g., PII scrubbing active, VLM
  extraction working).

- ScrubMiddleware: raise ImportError if openadapt-privacy missing, re-raise on scrubbing failure -
  extract_workflow(): raise ValueError on VLM parse failure, re-raise on VLM call failure -
  generate_transcript(): re-raise on VLM call failure, raise ValueError if parser returns only
  placeholders

## v0.48.1 (2026-03-20)

### Bug Fixes

- Dispatch task setup commands via /execute_windows instead of nonexistent /setup endpoint
  ([#153](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/153),
  [`b79cc72`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/b79cc72b148abe6fb9d4684904a104634b7d1c78))

The adapter was calling POST /setup to send all config entries at once, but neither the WAA server
  (port 5000) nor evaluate_server.py (port 5050) has this endpoint, causing SetupReadinessError on
  every task with setup commands.

Now each config entry (download, open, launch, execute, sleep, activate_window, verify_apps) is
  translated to a Python command and dispatched individually via /execute_windows. This is the last
  blocker before scored task evaluation and GRPO training.

## v0.47.3 (2026-03-19)

### Bug Fixes

- Auto-detect evaluate_url, waa_examples_path, and screen resolution
  ([#149](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/149),
  [`80d7990`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/80d7990382c86160d530a1acedc5a52cd4a6d925))

Three configuration improvements:

1. evaluate_url: when /evaluate returns 404 on the main server, auto-tries port 5050 (where
  evaluate_server.py runs). Caches the working URL.

2. waa_examples_path: auto-detects from WAA_EXAMPLES_PATH env var or common directory locations
  (WindowsAgentArena submodule paths).

3. Screen resolution: defaults to 1280x720 (matches typical WAA QEMU resolution) instead of
  1920x1200.

## v0.47.2 (2026-03-19)

### Bug Fixes

- **agent**: Add double_click support and anti-loop recovery to PlannerGrounderAgent
  ([#148](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/148),
  [`1c9a1bb`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/1c9a1bbbbd05096e1152c663df98804ddc1f9064))

- Add double_click to planner prompt action types with guidance to use it for opening applications,
  files, and desktop icons (fixes Windows 11 desktop icons requiring double-click) - Handle
  double_click in _build_action_from_structured by routing through the grounder for coordinates and
  overriding the returned click type - Add anti-loop detection that checks the last 3 planner
  instructions for exact string match and injects a WARNING into the planner prompt forcing a
  different strategy (fixes agent repeating the same failed action 15+ times) - Add dialog dismissal
  awareness to planner prompt (dismiss popups, notifications, and dialog boxes before attempting
  target actions) - Add 10 new tests covering double_click parsing, anti-loop detection, and dialog
  dismissal prompt content

### Documentation

- Add governed agent demo trace on macOS
  ([`76501cc`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/76501cce52b8c3d0c3cf686221a351269ab09c55))

First end-to-end test of the governed agent on a real macOS desktop: LocalAdapter + ScrubMiddleware
  + PlannerGrounderAgent (Claude).

5 steps: opened Apple menu, clicked System Settings, dismissed unexpected dialog, attempted
  recovery. Agent demonstrated adaptive behavior but didn't reach Displays in 5 steps.

Components validated: LocalAdapter screenshots + clicks, ScrubMiddleware wrapping,
  PlannerGrounderAgent planning + grounding, VLM evaluation.

## v0.47.1 (2026-03-19)

### Bug Fixes

- Replace Python patch script with shell script in Dockerfile
  ([#147](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/147),
  [`dfef844`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/dfef84412d456121452597ae70d713445ac70708))

* fix: replace Python patch script with shell script in Dockerfile

The base Docker image (dockurr/windows) doesn't have python3 installed. PR #145 introduced a Python
  patch script that fails with "python3: not found" during Docker build.

Fix: rewrite patch_setup_ps1.py as patch_setup_ps1.sh using awk/grep

(tools available in any minimal Linux). No dependencies required.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: Docker entry.sh path + shell patch script + Chrome experiment trace

Three fixes: 1. ./entry.sh → /run/entry.sh in docker run commands (relative path doesn't resolve in
  container, causing "No such file" on boot) 2. patch_setup_ps1.py → patch_setup_ps1.sh (base image
  has no python3) 3. Chrome task YAMLs dismiss sign-in dialog via --no-first-run flag

Includes successful Chrome experiment trace (score 1.0, 5/5 milestones, 8 steps): Claude planner +
  UI-Venus grounder completed "Set Chrome to auto-delete on-device site data when closing" on WAA
  VM.

## v0.47.0 (2026-03-19)

### Bug Fixes

- Align trace report test assertions with reset-step behavior
  ([#141](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/141),
  [`8c6b815`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/8c6b8155e3dd95b548cb4454efd37c63bb0057b0))

The test_report_with_trajectory test expected trajectory data from step_index=0 to appear in the
  report, but generate_trace_report.py skips trajectory metadata for Step 0 (Reset) by design.
  Updated assertions to match the actual report output: step_index=0 data is absent, while
  step_index=1 and 2 data appears correctly under Steps 1 and 2.

- Improve WAA VM infrastructure reliability
  ([#145](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/145),
  [`641e6e5`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/641e6e5adeeacf7007b73a8d05a7dc099a6d6f9f))

1. Remote Docker build: add missing files (evaluate_server.py, start_with_evaluate.sh,
  patch_setup_ps1.py) to the SCP file list in _build_remote(). Without these, the Dockerfile COPY
  commands fail because the build context is incomplete.

2. LibreOffice sed patch: replace fragile chained sed commands with a standalone Python patch script
  (patch_setup_ps1.py). The old second sed matched the wrong occurrence of Add-ToEnvPath after the
  first sed inserted text containing the same pattern.

3. Chrome sign-in dialog: add _is_chrome_task() detection and _prepare_chrome_clean_state() to
  suppress the "Sign in to Chrome" modal that blocks automation on fresh VMs. Uses registry policies
  (BrowserSignin=0, SyncDisabled=1, PromotionalTabsEnabled=0) and creates the "First Run" sentinel
  file. Also adds Chrome first-run suppression to _apply_clean_desktop_policy() and to the
  Dockerfile FirstLogonCommands for defense-in-depth.

4. Default CMD: add CMD directive to Dockerfile so containers don't exit immediately if started
  without explicit command arguments.

5. start_with_evaluate.sh: add fallback to /run/entry.sh when no CMD arguments are provided (empty
  $@).

- Use persistent storage for WAA data instead of ephemeral /mnt
  ([#144](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/144),
  [`bef392d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/bef392dbfd16477fbeed4459991d225715bc08f6))

Replace all /mnt/waa-storage with WAA_STORAGE_DIR constant pointing to /home/azureuser/waa-storage
  (persistent OS disk). Azure /mnt is ephemeral temp storage wiped on every deallocate, causing
  15-20 min cold reinstalls.

Also adds --os-disk-size-gb 128 to single-VM cmd_create path.

- Use structured planner output to prevent compound instruction drops
  ([#146](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/146),
  [`b311e13`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/b311e13de7fd548849e6e97efaa0c1ccd81afeb8))

* fix: use structured planner output to prevent compound instruction drops

The planner prompt now outputs structured action fields (action_type, action_value,
  target_description) instead of free-form instruction text. This fixes the compound instruction
  problem where type X then press Enter would only execute the type, dropping the Enter keypress.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: Chrome task setup dismisses sign-in dialog + compound instruction research

Chrome tasks now launch with --no-first-run --disable-sync and press Escape to dismiss any sign-in
  dialog. Settings task navigates directly to chrome://settings/cookies via CLI arg.

Also adds compound instruction research doc.

### Documentation

- Comprehensive workflow extraction pipeline + AReaL evaluation
  ([`e5e848d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e5e848d8be857a4df7b94b80f761edc429f2cb4c))

Workflow extraction pipeline (1350 lines, self-contained): - 4-pass pipeline: PII scrub → VLM
  transcript → workflow extraction → cosine matching - All Pydantic classes inline (11 classes) -
  Simple cosine similarity threshold (>0.85) instead of HDBSCAN - Full test strategy with synthetic
  data families - Cost analysis, integration points, file layout

AReaL evaluation: recommended as training backend.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

### Features

- Add workflow extraction Pydantic models, WAA adapter, and matching pipeline
  ([#142](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/142),
  [`fea40b6`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/fea40b63103b01854d74ea5f0b0dfb8cb5304cb3))

Implement Priority 1 of the workflow extraction pipeline: - Pydantic models for RecordingSession,
  Workflow, CanonicalWorkflow, WorkflowLibrary - WAARecordingAdapter to parse WAA meta.json
  recordings into normalized sessions - Cosine similarity matching for grouping workflows into
  canonical workflows - 31 tests with synthetic data families (settings toggles, spreadsheet entry,
  document formatting, file archiving) validating models, adapter, and matching

## v0.46.0 (2026-03-19)

### Features

- Add AReaL AgentWorkflow wrapping WAADesktopEnv for RL training
  ([#140](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/140),
  [`a7983cc`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/a7983cc423f497ddb81b6fa132da70be31e0b564))

Add proof-of-concept integration with AReaL (inclusionAI/AReaL), an async RL training framework. The
  WAADesktopWorkflow class implements AReaL's agent workflow pattern: an async run() method that
  receives task data and an OpenAI-compatible proxy URL, runs a full desktop automation episode
  against WAADesktopEnv, and returns a scalar reward.

New files: - openadapt_evals/training/areal_workflow.py: WAADesktopWorkflow class with
  screenshot-to-base64 encoding, multi-turn message building, action parsing via parse_action_json,
  and dense milestone rewards. - configs/areal_waa_grpo.yaml: AReaL config template for single-GPU
  GRPO training with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. - tests/test_areal_workflow.py: 14 tests covering
  episode execution, reward computation, edge cases, and message building.

AReaL is an optional dependency -- the workflow gracefully handles the case where AReaL is not
  installed. Tests use mock adapters and mock OpenAI clients (no real VM or AReaL needed).

## v0.45.1 (2026-03-19)

### Bug Fixes

- Update VLM judge prompt to recognize Windows 11 modern app UIs
  ([#139](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/139),
  [`116ec99`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/116ec9936c8ec2eb58eaa9c2e0bb0e91092e5631))

The VLM judge incorrectly scored successful experiments as 0.0 because Windows 11 Notepad has a
  modern UI (tabs, rounded corners, no classic menu bar) that the VLM did not recognize as Notepad.
  Added context to the judge prompt about Win11 app redesigns and updated the notepad-hello example
  task to use wildcard process matching for compatibility.

### Documentation

- Add planner-grounder experiment results report
  ([`540dde7`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/540dde7218e6276717604e64c84b97ec9f4db78c))

Four live runs with Claude planner + UI-Venus-1.5-8B grounder on WAA VM. Architecture validated:
  planner reasons correctly, grounder places accurate bounding boxes, non-click actions parse
  correctly, dense milestones work. Remaining issues are task design (Notepad session restore) and
  planner prompting (hallucination, loops), not architecture.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- Add research docs and design docs from Mar 17-18 session
  ([`d8c4f4d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/d8c4f4d83a71486fa84f5d5c2a452015d55f4490))

Research: - Planner-grounder literature review (40+ papers, terminology) - RL planner vs executor
  analysis (executor first, staged approach) - OSS planner alternatives (EvoCUA-32B + UI-Venus on 1x
  A10G) - Training targets in planner-grounder architecture (4 targets, staging) - Stack audit (what
  to keep/replace/simplify) - CODA and Agent Lightning evaluations (neither viable for desktop VLM
  RL)

Design: - ROI and cost analysis (planner distillation breaks even in 10-70 episodes) - Repo
  organization plan (what moves where after customer sprint)

- Add successful experiment trace (GIF + screenshots) and AReaL evaluation
  ([`866f32d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/866f32d369b937a28eed79a717438d17bdccd2dd))

Execution trace from successful planner-grounder run: - Claude planner + UI-Venus-1.5-8B grounder on
  WAA VM - 6 steps: Start → Notepad → focus → Ctrl+A → type "Hello World" → DONE - GIF animation +
  per-step screenshots with annotations

AReaL evaluation: recommended as training backend replacement for TRL. Same org as UI-Venus,
  first-class VLM support, async rollouts.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

### Features

- Add execution trace report generator from screenshots and trajectory data
  ([#138](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/138),
  [`5dab11c`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/5dab11c3cbdaabee401c0f3d1020454e2fdac83c))

Add scripts/generate_trace_report.py that reads step PNG screenshots and optionally a JSONL
  trajectory file (from PlannerTrajectoryLogger) to produce a markdown report with embedded
  screenshot references and per-step planner metadata (instruction, reasoning, decision).

Also add --generate-trace flag to scripts/run_planner_grounder.py which auto-enables
  --save-screenshots and attaches a PlannerTrajectoryLogger, then generates the trace report after
  the run completes.

## v0.44.0 (2026-03-18)

### Features

- Add LocalAdapter and ScrubMiddleware for governed desktop agent
  ([#137](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/137),
  [`523243b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/523243be248f7973d3985f939037d68916002a0e))

* feat: add LocalAdapter and ScrubMiddleware for governed desktop agent

LocalAdapter: BenchmarkAdapter for local desktop automation using mss

(screenshots) and pynput (mouse/keyboard). Handles HiDPI/Retina coordinate scaling, supports all
  action types (click, type, key, scroll, drag), and includes macOS accessibility permission
  handling.

ScrubMiddleware: Wraps any BenchmarkAdapter with mandatory PII

scrubbing via openadapt-privacy (Presidio). Every screenshot is scrubbed before reaching the agent.
  Original screenshots are retained for audit. Gracefully degrades when openadapt-privacy is not
  installed.

Includes 42 tests covering both components.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: skip pynput tests on headless Linux CI

TestKeyResolution imports pynput.keyboard.Key which requires an X display. Guard the import with
  try/except and skip the class when pynput is unavailable (headless CI runners).

- Add PlannerCache for caching planner API responses during training
  ([#136](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/136),
  [`2244c41`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/2244c412632f72664cfff04db895c13cb1280bb4))

Reduces API costs during GRPO training by caching planner responses keyed by perceptual screenshot
  hash (pHash) + task + action history. Visually similar screenshots produce cache hits even with
  minor pixel differences. Falls back to MD5 when imagehash is not installed.

- Add openadapt_evals/training/planner_cache.py (~100 lines) - Integrate optional planner_cache
  param into PlannerGrounderAgent - Add imagehash as optional [training] dependency - Add 9 tests
  covering miss/hit, key differentiation, and MD5 fallback

## v0.43.0 (2026-03-18)

### Features

- Add PlannerTrajectoryLogger for SFT training data collection
  ([#135](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/135),
  [`b08e0ef`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/b08e0ef2d75b9dfd292ac8f3edadab31f67f1822))

Add a trajectory logger that hooks into PlannerGrounderAgent to save each planner call's inputs and
  outputs during evaluation episodes. Successful episodes (reward > 0) are kept as supervised
  fine-tuning data for planner distillation; failed episodes are cleaned up.

## v0.42.1 (2026-03-18)

### Bug Fixes

- Pass action directly to env.step (preserves modifiers)
  ([`f828946`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/f828946b306362e420fb374859fe0da1c8365276))

The run script was reconstructing BenchmarkAction without modifiers, dropping Ctrl/Alt/Shift from
  hotkey actions. Now passes the original action object directly.

Also adds: - docs/design/roi_and_cost_analysis.md — full cost analysis -
  docs/research/planner_distillation.md — $5-35 to eliminate API costs -
  docs/research/ui_venus_rl_review.md — RL training code not public

## v0.42.0 (2026-03-18)

### Bug Fixes

- Remove --entrypoint override so evaluate_server.py starts automatically
  ([#133](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/133),
  [`ebae5a6`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/ebae5a651eac8ad7a7afe252b758e6985313fbf0))

The docker run commands used --entrypoint /bin/bash which overrode the Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT
  (start_with_evaluate.sh). This prevented evaluate_server.py from starting on port 5050, making
  /evaluate and /task/<id> endpoints unavailable.

Fix: remove --entrypoint, pass entry.sh as a command argument instead.

Also publish port 5050 in all three docker run locations.

- Wrap shell commands for /execute_windows and fix file_exists metric
  ([#131](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/131),
  [`e45c2b5`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e45c2b525c0862e6be000b7e26c5ebd84c807a23))

Two critical bugs that would cause failures on live VMs:

1. _run_vm_command() sent shell commands (PowerShell, cmd) directly to /execute_windows, which runs
  Python exec(). Shell commands caused SyntaxError. Now wraps in subprocess.run() so shell commands
  work.

2. file_exists metric doesn't exist in WAA metrics module — evaluator silently returns 0.0. Changed
  to exact_match which works with the "True"/"False" string output from the existence check.

### Features

- Add --correction-library and --enable-correction-capture CLI flags
  ([#130](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/130),
  [`2c15ca1`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/2c15ca161a36e158fe124610d5a9938621b23c3b))

Wires the correction flywheel into the `live` subcommand: - --correction-library PATH: load/store
  corrections for the flywheel - --enable-correction-capture: prompt for human corrections on
  failure - --controller, --max-retries, --max-replans: DemoController flags

When --controller is active with --correction-library, the controller checks stored corrections
  before replanning and captures new corrections when enabled.

- Add end-to-end GRPO training script with TRL + Unsloth
  ([#129](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/129),
  [`abcafe8`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/abcafe8d90a310a1242b12b7eddb8c8f0b675ed1))

One command to train: task YAMLs → dense rewards → GRPO.

Features: - --mock mode for pipeline validation (no VM/GPU) - --use-unsloth for VRAM efficiency
  (4bit + LoRA) - --task-dir loads YAML task configs with milestones - Dense rewards via milestones
  (reward = passed/total) - Configurable: model, group size, loss type, vLLM, learning rate - LoRA
  checkpoint loading (--lora-checkpoint)

Usage: python scripts/train_trl_grpo.py --task-dir ./example_tasks --mock python
  scripts/train_trl_grpo.py --task-dir ./tasks --server-url http://vm:5001

- Add PlannerGrounderAgent for dual-model GUI automation
  ([#134](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/134),
  [`a6eac6e`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/a6eac6eec7957ce331cf52dd04f39b7fc719e2fd))

* feat: add PlannerGrounderAgent for dual-model GUI automation

Implements the planner-grounder architecture from the GUI agent literature (SeeAct ICML 2024, UFO2
  2025, CODA 2025):

- Planner sees screenshot + a11y tree, outputs high-level instruction - Grounder sees screenshot +
  instruction, outputs pixel coordinates - Supports agent instances, VLM API calls, or HTTP
  endpoints - Action history tracking, DONE/FAIL handling, grounder retry - Registered in agent
  registry

23 tests passing.

* feat: OpenAI-compatible HTTP grounder + serving/run scripts

- HTTP grounder now uses OpenAI chat completions API format (compatible with vLLM, Ollama, any
  OpenAI-compatible server) - Sends screenshots as base64-encoded images - serve_grounder.sh: start
  UI-Venus-1.5-8B via vLLM - run_planner_grounder.py: full experiment script (Claude planner +
  UI-Venus grounder against WAA VM)

* fix: handle non-click actions and UI-Venus bbox format in PlannerGrounderAgent

Fixes from first live experiment (Claude planner + UI-Venus grounder on WAA VM):

1. Parse planner instructions for type/key/scroll actions — these bypass the grounder (which only
  returns click coordinates) 2. Planner prompt now requires ONE ATOMIC action per step (no compound
  "click X and type Y") 3. Grounder bbox parser handles UI-Venus [x1,y1,x2,y2] format, JSON format,
  and coordinate pairs 4. Float conversion for coordinates in run script and base.py 5. Added
  UI-Venus RL training review doc

Experiment result: planner correctly navigated Start → Notepad → text area. Grounder returned
  accurate bounding boxes. Typing failed because compound instructions weren't decomposed — now
  fixed.

* fix: hotkey handling, anti-loop, logging, screenshot saving

Four fixes from live experiment:

1. Key actions with modifiers (Ctrl+A) now use pyautogui.hotkey() instead of press(). Parser stores
  modifiers separately on BenchmarkAction. Adapter handles both modifier+key combos and legacy
  "ctrl+a" string format.

2. Planner prompt now includes anti-loop rule: "If your last 3 actions were the same, try a
  completely different approach."

3. Logging shows planner instruction correctly (was showing "?").

4. --save-screenshots flag saves PNGs at each step for debugging.

- Add WAA native JSON import to TaskConfig
  ([#132](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/132),
  [`279a5b3`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/279a5b328e2d1013068a5556fe66e34edb33686c))

Add from_waa_json() and from_waa_dir() classmethods so users who already have tasks in WAA's native
  JSON format can import them directly without rewriting in YAML.

- Simple evaluators (exact_match, contains, fuzzy_match, regex_match with
  vm_command_line/vm_file/literal) are reverse-translated to TaskCheck objects for full round-trip
  fidelity. - Specialised evaluators (compare_table, compare_font_names, etc.) are preserved
  verbatim via _raw_evaluator for lossless round-trip. - from_dir() now auto-detects .yaml/.yml and
  .json files. - 20 new tests covering import, round-trip, directory loading, domain inference, and
  mixed-format directories.

## v0.41.0 (2026-03-18)

### Features

- Add TRL GRPOTrainer rollout_func for WAA environments
  ([#127](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/127),
  [`578985a`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/578985a1b599ecdc230701b4512b950669a7f8dc))

make_waa_rollout_func() wraps WAADesktopEnv into TRL's experimental rollout_func API. Handles VLM
  multimodal generation (screenshot → action tokens), dense rewards via milestones, and action JSON
  parsing with thinking-token tolerance.

Includes parse_action_json() that handles common VLM quirks (markdown fences, thinking prefixes,
  unknown action types).

15 tests passing (10 parser + 5 integration with mock adapter).

## v0.40.0 (2026-03-18)

### Bug Fixes

- Remove python -c wrapping from VM command execution
  ([#126](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/126),
  [`9249a96`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/9249a96fb0431327be9bac6b52c1705cd39e874c))

_run_vm_command() was wrapping all commands in python -c "...", which broke PowerShell milestone
  commands. Commands are now sent directly to the WAA server's /execute_windows endpoint.

### Features

- Add OpenEnv-compatible WAA desktop environment
  ([#128](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/128),
  [`d30b3b5`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/d30b3b54a2e8213b5a275f961741fffadd66c8fa))

WAAOpenEnvEnvironment wraps RLEnvironment into Meta's OpenEnv standard (reset/step/state protocol).
  Can be served as HTTP+WebSocket via openenv-core's create_app(), or used standalone.

- WAAAction/WAAObservation/WAAState Pydantic models - Base64-encoded PNG screenshots in observations
  - Dense rewards via milestones when TaskConfig loaded - Server entry point: python -m
  openadapt_evals.openenv.server - 21 tests (models, environment, protocol compliance)

openenv-core is an optional dependency — the environment works standalone without it installed.

## v0.39.0 (2026-03-18)

### Features

- Add YAML-based custom task evaluation without forking WAA
  ([#125](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/125),
  [`e62377b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e62377b69eafdc9adb3b261a4affc29b441e0513))

* feat: add YAML-based custom task evaluation without forking WAA

Users can define tasks with setup commands and evaluation checks in simple YAML files. The WAA
  server already accepts evaluator configs in POST /evaluate — this module translates YAML into that
  format.

Four check types: - command: run PowerShell/Python on VM, check output - file: check file exists or
  contains expected content - screenshot: VLM judges screenshot (one-sentence description) - python:
  run arbitrary Python on VM

Includes milestone support for dense partial rewards, VLM-based screenshot evaluation, 5 example
  tasks (notepad, folder, calc, clear-browsing-data for Chrome and Edge), and 22 tests.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat: add dense partial rewards via milestones in RLEnvironment

RLEnvironment.evaluate_dense() uses TaskConfig milestones to compute partial credit
  (milestones_passed / total). This gives GRPO gradient signal even when no task fully completes —
  an agent passing 3/5 milestones gets reward 0.6 vs 0.0 for binary evaluation.

- evaluate_dense(): milestone-based evaluation, falls back to binary - load_task_config():
  convenience method to set TaskConfig - collect_rollout() uses dense rewards when milestones are
  defined - reset() uses TaskConfig for task loading (bypasses server lookup) - Trajectory info
  includes milestone_score, binary_score, counts

9 new tests, all passing. No changes to existing evaluate() behavior.

* fix: simplify execute command translation in TaskConfig

Execute setup commands were being double-wrapped in python -c. Now passed through as-is to WAA's
  execute handler.

Validated against live WAA VM: milestones correctly evaluate (VLM screenshot check + command check
  both work).

* test: add synthetic E2E pipeline tests for RL training

Validates full chain: TaskConfig YAML → RLEnvironment → collect_rollout → dense rewards → TRL
  rollout_func output shape.

Key test: multiple_rollouts_produce_reward_variance proves that milestone-based rewards produce
  [1.0, 0.67, 0.33, 0.0] across 4 rollouts — GRPO can compute meaningful advantages from this, even
  when binary task completion is 0%.

5 tests, no VM or GPU required (uses mock adapter).

## v0.38.1 (2026-03-18)

### Bug Fixes

- Use C8i/M8i instances for AWS nested virt (10x cheaper than metal)
  ([#124](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/124),
  [`828733f`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/828733f555202e19105c8c2b1ab3d08323901673))

### Features

- Add GiGPO anchor state computation to WAADesktopEnv
  ([#122](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/122),
  [`72aa537`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/72aa5370de78eeb8821a39a9a27e6bdc76073978))

* feat: add GiGPO anchor state computation to WAADesktopEnv

Add compute_anchor_state() function that produces a state key for GiGPO cross-rollout grouping. Uses
  a11y tree SHA256 hash (primary) with screenshot MD5 fallback. The state_key is included in the
  info dict from both reset() and step() so VAGEN/verl can use it for O(1) anchor grouping instead
  of recomputing perceptual hashes.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* docs: clarify VAGEN vs verl-agent distinction in decision doc

Add dated addendum (2026-03-16) correcting the earlier conflation of VAGEN and verl-agent as a
  single project. Key findings: VAGEN-Lite dropped Bi-Level GAE (only vanilla GRPO/PPO), GiGPO lives
  exclusively in verl-agent which uses its own env_base.py interface (not GymImageEnv), and our
  train_verl_e2e.py targets the wrong entry point. Outlines a corrected two-phase path: standalone
  GRPO first, then direct verl-agent integration if per-step credit is needed.

* docs: add comprehensive GRPO training research report

Covers desktop RL landscape (30+ projects), per-step credit assignment alternatives (HCAPO
  recommended over GiGPO), scaling architectures (ComputerRL, DART-GUI), and synthetic environment
  feasibility (GUI-Genesis). Includes revised architecture recommendation: standalone GRPO + HCAPO
  first, then dense rewards + API-GUI hybrid, then async scaling.

* docs: correct prioritization — validate GRPO before optimizing training math

HCAPO and per-step credit are Phase 3 optimizations, not Phase 1. The bottleneck is rollout success
  rate (getting non-zero rewards), not loss computation. Dense partial-credit rewards and API-GUI
  hybrid actions directly increase gradient signal and should come first.

## v0.37.0 (2026-03-16)

### Features

- Register HttpAgent in CLI with --agent http --agent-endpoint
  ([#119](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/119),
  [`2a64639`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/2a64639d375c43db1d5a67c744b4fca91a31f4d7))

Adds `http` as a valid agent type across all three CLI subcommands (mock, run, live). Requires
  `--agent-endpoint <URL>` when used.

Usage: openadapt-evals run --agent http --agent-endpoint http://gpu-box:8080 openadapt-evals live
  --agent http --agent-endpoint http://gpu-box:8080

## v0.36.0 (2026-03-16)

### Features

- Add HttpAgent, per-step evaluation, and lightweight trace export
  ([#118](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/118),
  [`e820c0a`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e820c0a52a5adc81bf474f878e8009e7592733ee))

Three platform infrastructure features:

1. HttpAgent (agents/http_agent.py): Generic agent-as-HTTP-service that forwards observations to any
  remote endpoint and parses BenchmarkAction responses. Enables teams to deploy custom agent stacks
  (model + prompt + parsing) as black-box HTTP servers, cleanly solving GPU/CPU separation.

2. Per-step evaluation in RLEnvironment: New evaluate_every_step parameter calls the WAA evaluator
  after each step and populates info["evaluation_score"]. Does NOT change the reward signal —
  training code decides how to use it. Useful for online RL training loops.

3. LightweightTraceExporter: Plain JSON + screenshots trace export with no openadapt-ml dependency.
  Produces episode JSON, manifest, and JSONL training samples in a universal format.

All 34 new tests pass. 984 existing tests unaffected.

## v0.35.2 (2026-03-08)

### Bug Fixes

- Detect and dismiss Windows lock screen before each task
  ([#117](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/117),
  [`4a28653`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/4a2865367ce0f9bd65a61ca8168cf1676b226197))

* feat: add correction flywheel (store, capture, parser, controller hooks)

Implements the correction flywheel MVP:

- correction_store.py: JSON-file-based correction library with save/find (fuzzy string matching via
  SequenceMatcher)/load_all - correction_capture.py: Human correction capture using
  openadapt-capture Recorder (primary) with PIL screenshot fallback - correction_parser.py: VLM call
  to parse before/after screenshots into PlanStep dict (think/action/expect) - demo_controller.py:
  Added correction_store and enable_correction_capture params. On retry exhaustion: check correction
  store -> inject match, or capture human correction -> parse -> store -> advance - cli.py: Added
  --correction-library and --enable-correction-capture flags

The loop: agent fails at step N -> correction store checked -> if match, inject corrected step -> if
  no match and capture enabled, human completes step -> Recorder captures -> VLM parses ->
  correction stored -> next run retrieves it.

17 tests added, all passing. 54 existing demo_controller tests unaffected.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: mock _has_recorder in correction capture test

The test was calling the real Recorder which may not have wait_for_ready in the installed version.
  Mock it to use the simple fallback path since this is a unit test.

* fix: detect and dismiss Windows lock screen before each task

Add _dismiss_lock_screen() to run_dc_eval.py that checks for LogonUI.exe process and types the
  password to unlock if the screen is locked. Called from ensure_waa_ready() after each successful
  probe.

This prevents eval failures when the Windows VM has been idle and the lock screen has engaged
  between tasks or between sessions.

* chore: sync beads state

## v0.35.1 (2026-03-07)

### Bug Fixes

- Use WAA server for /evaluate instead of fragile socat proxy
  ([#115](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/115),
  [`8bd1b43`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/8bd1b439de23d49072e68f457eda6c95f37e4153))

The evaluate endpoint (/evaluate) is already available on the WAA Flask server (port 5000), which is
  accessed via a single reliable SSH tunnel (local:5001 → VM:5000). The separate evaluate chain
  (local:5050 → VM:5051 → socat → docker exec → container:5050) was fragile and caused
  infrastructure failures when socat died mid-trial.

Changes: - Default --evaluate-url to None (falls back to --server URL) - Remove socat proxy setup
  (_setup_eval_proxy) from run_dc_eval.py - Remove port 5050 from SSH tunnel forwarding - Make
  done-gate non-fatal when evaluate returns infrastructure error - All scripts pass --evaluate-url
  only when explicitly set

## v0.35.0 (2026-03-06)

### Features

- Add Win32 API foreground check as alternative to a11y-based detection
  ([#114](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/114),
  [`81f89b0`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/81f89b0d98dcc0bd22f03464fe7193d3f1f76f28))

* feat: add Win32 API foreground check as alternative to a11y-based detection

Add _check_foreground_win32() method that uses GetForegroundWindow() + GetWindowText() via
  PowerShell P/Invoke for fast, reliable foreground window title checking. This replaces the slow
  a11y-based check as the default, while keeping a11y available via the focus_check_method config.

- New config field: focus_check_method (win32, a11y, or both) - New CLI flag: --focus-check-method
  for run and live subcommands - Detection of known-bad foreground states (Document Recovery, Start
  Center) - Dispatch method routes to win32, a11y, or both (win32 first, a11y fallback)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* test: update setup handler tests to mock win32 foreground check

The focus check default changed from a11y to win32, so tests need to mock run_powershell instead of
  requests.get for the /accessibility endpoint.

## v0.34.2 (2026-03-06)

### Bug Fixes

- Default strict_setup_readiness to False to avoid false infra failures
  ([#113](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/113),
  [`73111d3`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/73111d3a059c50b54293c2e9fecd043aad0861b7))

The post-setup focus check (PR #107) defaults to strict mode, which marks tasks as infrastructure
  failures when the a11y window enumeration can't find the expected app title. In practice,
  LibreOffice windows take longer to render titles than the check allows, causing ALL LibreOffice
  tasks to fail as infra — even though the app IS open.

Changing default to False: focus check still runs and logs warnings, but doesn't abort the task. The
  agent can recover from focus issues on its own (it did in all prior trials without this check).

Use --strict-setup-readiness to opt into the fatal behavior when the a11y detection is more
  reliable.

* feat: add done-gate to prevent agents from prematurely declaring task complete

When enabled via --done-gate, the evaluation runner calls adapter.evaluate() when the agent signals
  "done" to verify the task is actually complete. If the score is below the threshold (default 1.0),
  the runner overrides the "done" signal, appends a continuation message to the task instruction,
  and lets the agent continue. Limited to a configurable max overrides (default 3) to prevent
  infinite loops.

Research (ShowUI-Aloha) recommends 3-7 high-level phases in the PLAN section. The rule-based
  generator produced 13 granular steps (one per demo action), which defeats the purpose of having an
  abstract plan.

Condensed to 5 phases: create sheet, headers, years, formulas+fill, format as percentage.

Five blockers for running verl-agent training on g5.xlarge:

A) n_gpus default: 2 -> 1 (g5.xlarge has 1 GPU; multi-GPU is for g5.12xlarge) - train_verl_e2e.py
  argparse default - train_waa_vagen.yaml trainer.n_gpus_per_node - vm_cli.py gpu-train --n-gpus
  default

B) n_envs: 8 -> 1 (single WAA VM; GRPO group size is rollout.n, not n_envs) - train_waa_vagen.yaml
  envs[0].n_envs

C) Training entry point: verl.trainer.main_ppo -> vagen.main_ppo - VAGEN has its own entry point
  with Hydra config support - Added --config-path and --config-name Hydra args

D) Generated config: full training config -> env spec only - _generate_training_config now emits
  only the envs section - Algorithm, trainer, and rollout settings are Hydra overrides on CLI -
  data.train_files/val_files point to the env spec YAML

E) Rollout config: added VAGEN-required Hydra overrides - multi_turn.enable=True for multi-step
  desktop tasks - rollout.n={group_size} for GRPO group size - FSDP param/optimizer offload for
  single-GPU memory - gradient checkpointing enabled - total_training_steps replaces total_epochs
  (VAGEN uses steps) - Added evaluate_url to log output

## v0.30.0 (2026-03-04)

### Bug Fixes

- **controller**: Prevent plan step drift and reduce VLM false negatives
  ([#97](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/97),
  [`f1f3870`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/f1f3870c3d0dd1740b2943b9d25b28b14583e4a4))

* fix(controller): prevent plan step drift and reduce VLM false negatives

Two improvements to the closed-loop demo-conditioned controller:

1. Plan step tracking drift prevention: _advance_plan_steps() now only compares current step vs next
  step, advancing at most one step per call. Previously, bulk keyword matching could jump 5+ steps
  on a single action.

2. VLM verification prompt tuning: Added "partially_verified" status for cases where the core
  outcome is achieved but with minor deviations (cursor position, formatting). Rewrote all
  verification prompts to be outcome-focused, reducing false negatives from live eval scenarios.

Adds 68 new tests (8 drift prevention + 21 VLM prompt + 9 false-negative regressions + 30 existing
  test updates). All 147 controller tests pass.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* docs(cost): add LLM agent economics analysis

Analyzes unit economics of the closed-loop controller architecture: Claude agent costs, VLM verifier
  costs, scaling projections, and a three-phase strategy from loop-as-product to
  trained-model-as-product.

* fix(agent): replace pyautogui.drag() with mouseDown/moveTo/mouseUp

pyautogui.drag() uses relative coordinates that compound with starting position errors, making it
  unreliable for small targets like LibreOffice fill handles (~3x3 pixels). Replace with explicit
  mouseDown/moveTo/mouseUp sequence with timing delays for reliable drag operations.

Also adds drag case to _build_pixel_command() for the pixel_action() path.

* fix: prevent heuristic/verifier drift and surface partial steps in goal verification

Three issues addressed:

1. Heuristic/verifier step drift: The agent's keyword-based _advance_plan_steps() heuristic and the
  DemoController's VLM verifier operated on independent state, allowing them to disagree on which
  step was current. Fix: add _external_step_control flag to the agent that the DemoController sets
  at init, making _advance_plan_steps() a no-op when the controller manages step progression via VLM
  verification.

2. partially_verified invisible to goal verification: When steps were marked partially_verified, the
  final goal verification pass had no visibility into which steps had partial completions. Fix:
  _verify_goal() now builds a step verification summary and augments the goal text with it when
  noteworthy statuses (partially_verified, failed) exist.

3. Missing integration tests: Added TestHeuristicVerifierSync (4 tests) and
  TestGoalVerificationContext (5 tests) that verify the heuristic is properly disabled under
  controller management, step advancement is driven by VLM verification, and partial/failed step
  context reaches goal verification. Also added 2 agent-level tests for _external_step_control
  behavior.

* fix: suppress stale agent plan progress under external step control

When DemoController sets _external_step_control=True, the agent's internal plan progress injection
  and done-override logic now become no-ops. This prevents the agent from sending conflicting
  step-tracking signals to the Claude model (agent says "step 1 in progress" while controller says
  "step 3 is current").

Three specific suppressions: 1. _build_initial_messages skips plan progress text injection 2.
  Follow-up messages skip plan progress / demo re-injection 3. Premature "done" override is left to
  the controller

Adds integration tests exercising agent+controller interaction: - Agent suppresses progress under
  external control - Agent injects progress normally without external control - Controller's
  augmented task instruction reaches the agent - Done override handled by controller, not agent

* fix(adapter): ensure target app is focused after task setup

After WAA setup (close_all → verify_apps → download → open), the target application may be behind
  other windows, still loading, or obscured by notifications. This wastes 6+ agent steps recovering.

Add _ensure_app_focused() with multi-strategy approach: - Maps task related_apps to window title
  patterns - Uses WAA /setup/activate_window endpoint (same as WAA postconfig) - Falls back to
  Alt+Tab - Retries 3x with increasing delays (2s, 3s, 5s) - Verifies foreground window title via
  pygetwindow on VM - Runs during reset(), does NOT count against agent step budget

Also adds _APP_WINDOW_PATTERNS mapping, _get_expected_window_patterns(),
  _check_foreground_matches(), and _normalize_app_name() helpers.

* docs: add systematic failure mode analysis and training strategy

Comprehensive analysis of GUI agent failure modes with taxonomy, recording system design, training
  viability assessment, and prioritized action plan. Key findings:

- 4-category taxonomy: Environment, Agent Planning, Grounding, Verifier - Existing
  ExecutionTraceCollector needs only minor extensions - SFT on 50-100 corrected trajectories
  expected 10-30pp improvement - Deterministic infrastructure fixes should come first (Tier 1)

* fix: address PR #97 review comments with clarifying comments and test dep

- Add comment in reset() explaining why _external_step_control is not reset - Add comment on hasattr
  guard explaining MagicMock behavior is acceptable - Add docstring note in
  TestFalseNegativeRegressions about VLM response limitation - Add flask to test
  optional-dependencies for CI coverage

* feat: add GPU training automation for verl-agent E2E workflow

- Add GPU_VM_SIZE_FALLBACKS to azure_vm.py (NC48ads_A100_v4, NC24ads, NC12s_v3) - Add
  GPU_INSTANCE_TYPE_FALLBACKS to aws_vm.py (p3.8xlarge, g5.12xlarge, p3.2xlarge) - Update

  gpu-setup and gpu-train CLI commands

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: correct verl-agent Hydra config paths and document integration gap

Validated all 17 Hydra config paths against verl-agent's actual schema (ppo_trainer.yaml +
  make_envs()). Key fixes:

- env.env_name: use 'waa_desktop' short name, not Python import path (verl-agent uses hardcoded
  dispatch, not dynamic imports) - Remove env.env_kwargs (doesn't exist), use env.waa.* sub-keys -
  Add data.train_files/val_files (required parquet, generated via data_preprocess.prepare --mode
  visual) - Add missing overrides: algorithm.gamma, gpu_memory_utilization, ppo_mini_batch_size,
  filter_overlong_prompts, test_freq - Add prepare_training_data() and patch_env_manager() steps -
  Document the EnvironmentManagerBase integration gap in decision doc

* fix: replace EnvironmentManagerBase with VAGEN registry-based env integration

The previous implementation incorrectly assumed verl-agent uses an EnvironmentManagerBase ABC with a
  hardcoded make_envs() dispatch. Research reveals VAGEN actually uses: - GymImageEnv protocol
  (which WAADesktopEnv already implements) - YAML-based env registry
  (vagen/configs/env_registry.yaml) - GymAgentLoop for training-time rollout orchestration

Changes: - Replace patch_env_manager() with register_waa_env() (YAML registry) - Add
  register_in_vagen() and generate_env_spec() helpers to verl_env.py - Update launch_training() to
  generate proper VAGEN training config - Fix Integration Gap section in decision doc (no
  EnvironmentManagerBase) - Update training config YAML with architecture diagram - Add 5 new tests
  for registration helpers (40 total, all passing) - Export new helpers from adapters/__init__.py

* fix: correct is_action_valid logic, scroll_direction, stale refs, and DRY violation

Review fixes for the GPU training automation branch:

- Fix is_action_valid: was inverted (DONE()→invalid, garbage→valid), now uses regex match on
  original action string - Fix scroll_direction: SCROLL parsing now populates
  BenchmarkAction.scroll_direction - Fix stale repo URLs: mll-lab-nu/VAGEN → RAGEN-AI/VAGEN across
  vendored files and docs - Fix stale branch ref: setup_gpu_training.sh referenced merged spike
  branch, now uses main - Fix stale repo URL: langfengQ/verl-agent → RAGEN-AI/VAGEN in setup script
  - Add --recurse-submodules to git clone (verl is a VAGEN submodule) - Remove dead params from
  register_waa_env() (waa_server, task_id, max_steps) - Deduplicate training command: vm_cli.py now
  delegates to launch_training() - Update test count in docs: 21 → 40+ - Add 3 new tests for
  is_action_valid behavior - Add scroll_direction assertion to existing scroll test

All 43 tests pass.

* fix: resolve lint errors (undefined use_fast, unused imports, f-strings)

- Remove undefined `use_fast` guard — always log tried sizes on failure - Remove unused PoolManager
  import in vm_cli.py - Remove extraneous f-string prefixes - Remove unused boto3 and SSH_OPTS
  imports in aws_vm.py

* fix: add evaluate_url support and E2E validation test

WAADesktopEnv now correctly separates: - server_url (port 5000): Windows VM Flask API (/screenshot,
  /execute_windows) - evaluate_url (port 5001): evaluate_server.py (/setup, /evaluate, /probe)

Previously, the single server_url default pointed at 5001 (evaluate server only), which caused 404s
  for screenshots and action execution.

Also adds scripts/test_verl_env_e2e.py, validated on AWS g5.xlarge (A10G) with UNIX socket bridge
  proxy chain to Azure WAA VM.

* fix: use Deep Learning AMI for GPU instances and fix setup issues

- Add _find_latest_dl_ami() for GPU VMs (pre-installed NVIDIA drivers + CUDA) - Add gpu param to
  create_vm() to select DL AMI vs standard Ubuntu - Reorder GPU_INSTANCE_TYPE_FALLBACKS: prefer g5
  (Ampere/A10G) over p3 (Volta/V100) since OSS NVIDIA driver requires GSP (Turing+) - Make
  OPENADAPT_EVALS_BRANCH configurable via env var in setup script - Add conda TOS acceptance step
  (required since Miniconda 2025)

Validated on AWS g5.xlarge with NVIDIA A10G 24GB GPU.

* docs: add GPU E2E validation report with artifacts

Documents the successful end-to-end validation of the verl-agent/VAGEN training pipeline on AWS
  g5.xlarge (A10G 24GB) connecting to Azure WAA VM. Includes architecture diagrams, proxy chain
  details, raw test output, version listings, and issues discovered during validation.

* fix: resolve port inconsistencies and add missing context in validation docs

- Standardize evaluate_url port to 5051 (socat bridge) across all docs - Add Artifact Stage column
  to validation results table mapping tests to raw output - Add docs commit (c2555ef) to PR #87
  commit list - Clarify 5050 vs 5051 port mapping in architecture diagrams and data flow - Expand
  e2e_test_output.txt Stage 7/8 with sub-steps matching README table - Add SSH tunnel tip about
  socat bridge still being required

* fix: clarify uvicorn version discrepancy and complete commit list

- Add note to gpu_vm_stack_versions.txt explaining that the full pip list is from Stage 5 (vLLM
  install) and uvicorn was later downgraded by VAGEN - Add b7efb4f to the commit list in README.md

* fix: guard flash-attn install for Ampere+ GPUs and validate training data

- Check GPU compute capability before installing flash-attn; V100s (sm_70) don't support Flash
  Attention 2 (requires sm_80+) and would fail at build or runtime - Add post-preparation validation
  to prepare_training_data() ensuring the expected parquet files exist and are non-empty, rather
  than silently proceeding with missing data

* fix: update test to match server_url default port 5000

The generate_env_spec() default server_url is http://localhost:5000 (WAA Flask API port), not 5001.
  The test expectation was stale.

* fix: split server_url/evaluate_url in training config and CLI args

The two-port WAA architecture uses separate endpoints: - server_url (port 5000): WAA Flask API for
  screenshots and actions - evaluate_url (port 5001): evaluate_server for setup and evaluate

Previously --waa-server defaulted to port 5001 and was assigned to server_url, conflating the two
  endpoints. This fixes: - train_verl_e2e.py: --waa-server default 5000, add --evaluate-server -
  vm_cli.py gpu-train: same CLI arg fixes, pass evaluate_url through - train_waa_vagen.yaml: correct
  server_url to 5000, add evaluate_url - Fix nested single quotes in register_waa_env (heredoc
  instead) - Replace fragile sys.path.insert with importlib.util

* fix: correct stale port in verl_env docstring and SSH tunnel comment

- verl_env.py docstring: server_url example 5001 -> 5000, add evaluate_url - train_waa_vagen.yaml:
  SSH tunnel dest 5050 -> 5051 (socat bridge, not broken Docker port)

## v0.27.1 (2026-03-03)

### Bug Fixes

- Add direct pixel path for pixel_action bypassing element routing
  ([#91](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/91),
  [`e25b15b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e25b15b798747f232eac5fdff1f9fb78c50dad39))

Extract command-sending logic from step() into _send_command() helper. Rewrite pixel_action() to
  build pyautogui commands directly via _build_pixel_command() and send them through
  _send_command(), bypassing _translate_action/_translate_click_action entirely.

This eliminates unnecessary element-resolution routing for actions that already have absolute pixel
  coordinates. The step() method continues to use the element-based _translate_action path for agent
  actions.

## v0.25.0 (2026-03-03)

### Bug Fixes

- **agent**: Replace manual string escaping with repr() and fix CU agent bugs
  ([#83](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/83),
  [`9bbf729`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/9bbf729dd138b9cac8a9f9b4c95bfb786e221a98))

* fix(agent): replace manual string escaping with repr() and fix CU agent bugs

Five reliability fixes for eval runs:

1. Replace _escape_for_pyautogui() with repr() in _build_type_commands() - eliminates entire class
  of string-embedding bugs (newlines, tabs, quotes, unicode) using Python's own escaping mechanism

2. Fix drag coordinate field names: startCoordinate/endCoordinate (camelCase) →
  start_coordinate/coordinate (snake_case) per Claude computer_use API

3. Add _clamp_coord() to prevent (0,0) coordinates from triggering PyAutoGUI fail-safe, applied to
  click, drag, and mouse_move actions

4. Re-inject demo text at every step in tool_result messages to prevent context drift in
  demo-conditioned evaluation

5. Add command logging in WAALiveAdapter.step() for debugging

Also adds docs/eval_analysis_2026_03_02.md documenting ZS vs DC eval results and literature review
  on demo-conditioning approaches.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat: add multi-level demo format transform and fix tests

- Add scripts/transform_demo_format.py: transforms rigid {Observation, Intent, Action, Result} demos
  into adaptive {Think, Action, Expect} format with PLAN section (Option D from eval analysis) -
  LLM-assisted mode (default): uses vlm_call() for semantic transform - Rule-based mode (--no-llm):
  free, no API calls needed - Supports --dry-run for preview

- Fix tests for repr() escaping and coordinate clamping: - Remove TestEscapeForPyautogui (tests
  deleted function) - Update TestBuildTypeCommands for repr() output format - Add
  test_all_special_chars_produce_valid_python invariant test - Fix drag test to use snake_case field
  names - Fix coordinate edge test to expect clamped (0.005, 0.005)

- Regenerate uv.lock for consilium package name resolution

* docs: add DC-multilevel eval results to analysis

DC-multilevel (new {Think, Action, Expect} + PLAN format) showed clear improvement over DC-rigid:
  agent followed the plan, entered all headers and years, typed correct formula, used drag-fill.
  Still scored 0.0 due to premature task completion (finished 1/3 columns), but qualitatively the
  best behavior across all three conditions.

* feat: add VAGEN/verl-agent environment adapter for VLM RL training

WAADesktopEnv implements the GymImageEnv protocol from VAGEN, enabling desktop GUI automation
  training with verl-agent's multi-turn VLM RL pipeline (GiGPO, GRPO, PPO).

The adapter translates between openadapt-evals BenchmarkObservation (PNG bytes + a11y tree) and
  VAGEN's observation format (obs_str + multi_modal_input with PIL images).

- Async interface (reset/step/close/system_prompt) - Action DSL parsing (CLICK, TYPE, KEY, SCROLL,
  WAIT, DONE) - Fractional coordinate support (0.0-1.0) - Lazy adapter initialization - 21 tests
  passing with mock adapter - Example VAGEN training config included

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* docs: add comprehensive verl-agent decision document

Records the full reasoning chain for choosing verl-agent/VAGEN: - Framework comparison (TRL,
  standalone, verl-agent, VAGEN, OpenRLHF, Unsloth) - Key insight: per-step verification via GiGPO
  for long-horizon GUI tasks - TRL multi-turn VLM blocker (issues #5119, #5120) - "Environment is
  the moat" strategic framing - Architecture diagram and migration path

* feat: add verl-agent as optional dependency

* feat: vendor GymImageEnv base classes from VAGEN

* docs: fact-check framework review in verl decision doc

Update Sections E (OpenRLHF), F (Unsloth), TRL, and comparison matrix with accurate details from
  thorough review:

- OpenRLHF: document AgentTrainer multi-turn support and OpenRLHF-M fork - Unsloth: nuanced
  assessment — single-turn VLM works, multi-turn text via ART works, but multi-turn VLM blocked by
  rollout_func issue (#3573) - TRL: add note about OpenEnv/rollout_func for text models (VLM
  blocked) - Comparison matrix: add Unsloth column with footnotes

### Features

- Add self-contained GRPO training example script
  ([#81](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/81),
  [`0cdee7f`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/0cdee7f67e264710e47d7ca94bdbd1031636b00a))

* feat: add self-contained GRPO training example script

250-line example showing the full RL training loop: model loading → rollout collection → GRPO loss →
  weight update → checkpoint.

No openadapt-ml dependency — all GRPO math, action parsing, and log-prob computation are inline.
  Uses RLEnvironment from openadapt-evals.

Includes --mock flag for testing without a VM.

Usage: python scripts/train_grpo_example.py --mock --num-steps 3 python
  scripts/train_grpo_example.py --server http://localhost:5001 --task-id <UUID>

* fix: align GRPO training example with openadapt-ml trainer

- Align SYSTEM_PROMPT with openadapt_ml.datasets.next_action.SYSTEM_PROMPT - Use chat template for
  prompt construction (not raw string concatenation) - Fix screen height default: 1080 (was 1200) -
  Fix LoRA target_modules: 4 projections (was 2) matching ml trainer - Fix coordinate fallback: use
  format_action_as_text with normalized fractions (was using raw pixel coords like x=960) - Add
  WAIT() handler in parse_action (was falling through to DONE) - Fix TYPE regex to handle escaped
  quotes and backslashes - Fix loss scaling: divide by (n_valid * num_steps) matching ml trainer -
  Rename grpo_loss to policy_gradient_loss with honest docstring - Add build_agent_messages and
  format_action_as_text helper functions

## v0.23.0 (2026-03-03)

### Features

- Add 4-layer WAA probe for per-layer diagnostics
  ([#75](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/75),
  [`96b726e`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/96b726e91fddec7aaa02f0200c40613582ca2e05))

Add multi-layer probe that tests screenshot (PNG capture), accessibility (a11y tree), action
  (pyautogui pipeline), and score (evaluate endpoint) layers individually using existing WAA
  endpoints. No server-side changes.

- New probe.py module with ProbeLayerResult/MultiLayerProbeResult dataclasses - CLI: --detailed,
  --json, --layers, --evaluate-url args on probe command - VMMonitor: check_waa_detailed() method
  and waa_detailed_probe field - 41 tests covering all layers, orchestrator, and helpers

## v0.22.0 (2026-03-03)

### Features

- Add RL environment wrapper for GRPO training
  ([#73](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/73),
  [`2678f43`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/2678f4346e16e271ef131fbda46664614c8eddd0))

* feat: add `smoke-test-aws` CLI command with full lifecycle test

Add `oa-vm smoke-test-aws` command that runs incremental verification stages against real AWS
  infrastructure:

Read-only stages (default): 1. AWS credentials (STS get_caller_identity) 2. SSH public key
  (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) 3. AMI lookup (latest Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) 4. Instance type availability
  (find_available_size_and_region) 5. VPC infrastructure (ensure_vpc_infrastructure)

Full lifecycle stages (--full): 6. Create VM (m5a.xlarge, $0.17/hr) 7. SSH connectivity
  (wait_for_ssh + hostname) 8. Stop/Start cycle (deallocate -> start -> verify IP refresh) 9.
  Cleanup (delete -> verify terminated)

Also fixes two bugs in AWSVMManager discovered during testing: - deallocate_vm: now waits for
  'stopped' state before returning (previously returned immediately, causing start_vm to fail with
  IncorrectInstanceState) - delete_vm: now waits for 'terminated' state before returning (previously
  returned immediately, so callers couldn't verify termination)

Tested: 9/9 stages passed on real AWS (us-east-1, ~1m42s total).

* docs: add screenshots of Windows 11 running on AWS EC2

Screenshots captured from m5.metal instance in us-east-1: - aws-waa-installing.png: Windows 11
  installer at 42% on EC2 - aws-waa-windows-desktop.png: Full Windows 11 desktop with Start menu

Proves the full WAA stack works on AWS: EC2 m5.metal → Docker → QEMU/KVM → Windows 11 with all
  benchmark apps (Notepad, Calculator, Settings, Edge, etc.)

* chore: sync beads state

* docs: add AWS support section with cost analysis to CLAUDE.md

Documents AWS workflow (smoke-test-aws, pool commands with --cloud aws), m5.metal cost breakdown per
  phase, and references the Windows 11 screenshot.

* feat: add RL environment wrapper for GRPO training

Add RLEnvironment class with Gymnasium-style reset/step/observe/evaluate cycle for online RL
  training. Add pixel_action(), observe(), and screen_size to WAALiveAdapter. Includes stuck
  detection, normalized coordinate support, example rollout script, docs, and 14 unit tests.

## v0.21.1 (2026-03-03)

### Bug Fixes

- Address round-2 review findings across pipeline and live adapter
  ([#79](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/79),
  [`32a2542`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/32a254250b6ceda7577dd72ee171a597a4f8355e))

Pipeline (run_eval_pipeline.py): - Add timeout=3600 to eval subprocess to prevent indefinite hangs -
  Guard _ensure_waa_ready against empty vm_ip (skip tunnel reconnect) - Capture demo generation
  output to prevent thread-interleaved stdout - Make eval_tasks a defensive copy instead of alias

Live adapter (live.py): - Decouple _build_type_commands from callers: return body without import
  prefix, eliminating fragile removeprefix coupling - Escape tab characters in _escape_for_pyautogui

Tests (test_waa.py): - Add 18 tests for _escape_for_pyautogui and _build_type_commands covering edge
  cases: empty text, newlines, tabs, quotes, formulas

## v0.21.0 (2026-03-03)

### Features

- Add end-to-end eval pipeline script
  ([#68](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/68),
  [`f6cd170`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/f6cd170037341e0b7582a80d133c60cc4f990ecf))

* feat: add end-to-end eval pipeline script

Orchestrates the full evaluation flow in a single command: - Phase 1 (parallel): generate VLM demos
  + start VM if deallocated - Phase 2: establish SSH tunnels, socat proxy, wait for WAA readiness -
  Phase 3: run ZS and DC evaluations with health checks - Phase 4: print results summary

Composes existing scripts (run_dc_eval, convert_recording_to_demo) without modifying them. Supports
  --dry-run, --tasks, --zs-only/--dc-only, --skip-vm.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: inline tunnel functions to avoid module-level import failures

The previous approach imported functions from run_dc_eval.py which imports openadapt_evals at module
  level. This fails when running as a standalone script outside the uv environment. Inlining the
  small subprocess-based functions avoids the dependency chain.

* fix: add container restart, VNC viewer, and longer WAA timeout

- Check and restart stopped WAA container in Phase 2 (handles VM deallocate/start where container
  exits) - Increase default WAA readiness timeout from 420s to 1200s (cold boot can take 15-35 min)
  - Add --vnc/--no-vnc flags to open VNC in browser (default: on)

* fix: failsafe recovery for 500 responses and coordinate clamping

Three fixes for the PyAutoGUI fail-safe issue:

1. Failsafe detection now checks ALL response statuses, not just 200. WAA returns fail-safe errors
  as HTTP 500 with the exception in the response body — the previous code only checked stderr on 200
  responses. Also detect "fail-safe triggered" substring (WAA's error format).

2. Coordinate clamping: all pixel coordinates are clamped to a 5px margin from screen edges via
  _clamp_pixel_coords(), preventing accidental corner touches that trigger the fail-safe.

3. Drag coordinate validation: skip drag actions with missing or all-zero coordinates instead of
  defaulting to (0,0) which guarantees a fail-safe trigger.

* docs: add experimental analysis for task 04d9aeaf DC eval

Comprehensive analysis of ZS vs DC evaluation on a 21-step LibreOffice Calc task. Key findings: -
  ZS: stuck after 1 step (wait loop) - DC: 30 steps, wrote 4 correct cross-sheet formulas for 1 of 3
  columns - Binary scoring (0.00 both) masks significant DC behavioral advantage - Documents 3
  infrastructure bugs found and fixed during eval

* feat: add --deallocate-after flag to eval pipeline

Adds a --deallocate-after flag that deallocates the VM after eval completes to stop billing. Uses
  raw az CLI because oa-vm deallocate hardcodes VM_NAME="waa-eval-vm" and doesn't accept --name, so
  it won't work for pool-style VMs like waa-pool-00.

* refactor: remove live.py changes (moved to fix/harden-failsafe-detection)

* test: add unit tests for eval pipeline functions

- Test _build_conditions with zs-only, dc-only, default, both-flags, multiple tasks, JSON fallback,
  and warning output - Test _find_recordings_needing_demos with mocked filesystem covering existing
  demos, missing demos, no recording dir, no meta.json, meta_refined.json, task filters, and sorted
  output - Test _print_summary for success/failure/empty/skip scenarios - Test CLI argument parsing
  defaults and flag behavior - Test --dry-run integration (exit codes and output content) - Test
  module-level constants - All 54 tests run without VM access

* refactor: use VMProvider protocol and deduplicate infra in eval pipeline

- Replace Azure-only az CLI calls with VMProvider interface (supports AWS) - Fix macOS-only VNC
  opener with cross-platform webbrowser.open() - Replace duplicate SSH/tunnel functions with
  infrastructure module calls - Capture eval subprocess output for cleaner pipeline logs

* fix: update tests for VMProvider refactor (remove DEFAULT_VM_USER)

- Remove references to removed DEFAULT_VM_USER constant - Replace --vm-user with --cloud in test
  parser - Add --deallocate-after to test parser - 53/53 tests pass

* fix: handle newlines in type actions to prevent unterminated string errors

When the agent sends text containing newlines, pyautogui.write() was called with a literal newline
  in the Python string, causing an "unterminated string literal" syntax error on the WAA server.

Adds _build_type_commands() which splits text on newlines and interleaves pyautogui.write() with
  pyautogui.press('enter'). Also extracts _escape_for_pyautogui() for consistent string escaping.

Updates analysis doc: corrects partial-scoring recommendation to note it requires WAA server-side
  changes (compare_table metric), not just adapter-side changes.

* fix: address review feedback for eval pipeline

- Guard _create_vm_manager() behind dry-run check so --dry-run works without Azure/AWS SDKs
  configured - Remove unused as_completed import - Add parentheses to clarify sorted() if/else
  expression - Make _build_type_commands() self-contained (includes import pyautogui) so
  concatenation at call sites is no longer fragile - Extract build_parser() from main() so tests use
  the real parser instead of a manually reconstructed copy

* docs: add AWS as supported cloud backend in README

- Update description, key features, and architecture to mention both Azure and AWS - Add aws extra
  to installation section - Show --cloud aws examples in Quick Start and Parallel Evaluation - Add
  aws_vm.py to architecture tree - Add smoke-test-aws to CLI reference table - Add AWS env vars to
  configuration section - Add Windows 11 on AWS screenshot

## v0.19.2 (2026-03-02)

### Bug Fixes

- Unify fuzzy_match metrics into shared evaluation.metrics module
  ([#71](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/71),
  [`99e5b23`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/99e5b23b8b9128ee319627aba5a7aaea937cfde5))

Extract metric functions (exact_match, fuzzy_match, contains, boolean, file_exists) into
  evaluation/metrics.py as the single source of truth. Both client.py and evaluate_endpoint.py now
  delegate to this module, eliminating the divergence between word-set overlap and rapidfuzz
  implementations.

## v0.19.1 (2026-03-02)

### Bug Fixes

- Rename consilium dependency to openadapt-consilium and revert Python 3.11 requirement
  ([#69](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/69),
  [`e42607d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e42607dbd5f2139d2a32f555c2bfcc793cfe193b))

The `consilium` name on PyPI belongs to another project. `openadapt-consilium` v0.3.2 is now
  published with requires-python >=3.10, so we can revert our temporary Python 3.11 bump and use the
  correct package name.

Changes: - Rename `consilium>=0.1.0` to `openadapt-consilium>=0.3.2` in dependencies - Update
  `[tool.uv.sources]` key from `consilium` to `openadapt-consilium` - Revert `requires-python` from
  `>=3.11` back to `>=3.10` - Re-add `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10` classifier

## v0.19.0 (2026-03-02)

### Features

- Add multi-cloud VM support with AWS backend and VMProvider protocol
  ([#66](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/66),
  [`d09e822`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/d09e8227ad0a397956c87bf8db1b1558a34a13ca))

* feat: add multi-cloud VM support with AWS backend and VMProvider protocol

- Create VMProvider Protocol (typing.Protocol) for cloud-agnostic VM management - Create
  AWSVMManager with boto3 for EC2 lifecycle (create, delete, start, stop) - Add
  resource_scope/ssh_username properties to AzureVMManager - Add
  list_pool_resources/cleanup_pool_resources to AzureVMManager - Parameterize pool.py SSH calls and
  scripts with username/home_dir - Add --cloud flag (azure|aws) to all pool CLI commands - Add
  cloud_provider/aws_region to config.py settings - Add boto3 optional dependency
  (openadapt-evals[aws]) - Update tests for WAA_START_SCRIPT_TEMPLATE rename

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: address review findings in AWS VM backend

- Fix DOCKER_SETUP_SCRIPT_WITH_ACR daemon.json double-brace corruption that produced invalid JSON
  ({{"data-root"...}}) breaking Docker start - Use .metal instance types for AWS (KVM/nested virt
  required for QEMU) - Fix region mismatch: update self.region and invalidate cached clients when
  create_vm uses a different region than the manager default - Fix hardcoded "azureuser" in
  pool-wait diagnostic message - Set AWSVMManager = None on ImportError so `import *` doesn't raise
  - Only delete pool registry on successful cleanup (prevents orphaned cloud resources when deletion
  fails) - Remove unused `time` import from aws_vm.py

* fix: address second review findings

- Fix pool-vnc/pool-logs/pool-exec hardcoded azureuser: read ssh_username from pool registry with
  backward-compatible default - Store ssh_username in VMPool dataclass and persist to registry on
  create - Move set_auto_shutdown after SSH is available (was racing with boot) - Fix
  cleanup_pool_resources: handle raw instance IDs and allocation IDs for resources without Name tags
  (prevents orphaned resources) - Narrow key pair exception handling: re-raise unless
  InvalidKeyPair.NotFound - Add TODO for restricting SSH security group to user's IP

* fix: restore ssh_username on registry load, fix EIP disassociate API

- Add ssh_username to VMPoolRegistry.load() so it persists across process restarts (was silently
  reverting to "azureuser" default) - Fix disassociate_address for raw allocation IDs: look up
  AssociationId via describe_addresses first (disassociate_address does not accept AllocationId
  parameter)

## v0.18.0 (2026-03-02)

### Features

- Migrate annotation pipeline from openadapt-ml to openadapt-evals
  ([#64](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/64),
  [`7ee817d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/7ee817d75f171bf26ddde02449060eaa6d6979a2))

* feat: migrate annotation pipeline from openadapt-ml to openadapt-evals

Move annotation data classes, prompts, and utilities into openadapt_evals.annotation and consolidate
  three separate VLM call implementations into a shared openadapt_evals.vlm module.

- New openadapt_evals/vlm.py: unified vlm_call() supporting consilium council, OpenAI, and
  Anthropic; extract_json() for LLM output parsing; image_bytes_from_path() helper - New
  openadapt_evals/annotation.py: AnnotatedStep/AnnotatedDemo data classes,
  ANNOTATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT/ANNOTATION_STEP_PROMPT constants, parse_annotation_response(),
  validate_annotations(), format_annotated_demo() - Updated scripts/record_waa_demos.py
  cmd_annotate_waa() to import from openadapt_evals instead of openadapt_ml - Updated
  scripts/refine_demo.py to use shared vlm_call/extract_json, refactored message builders to
  prompt+images interface - Updated scripts/convert_recording_to_demo.py to use shared vlm_call - 16
  new tests in tests/test_annotation.py, all existing tests pass

Closes #59

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: remove unused import and hoist model resolution in convert_recording_to_demo

- Remove unused `import os` from openadapt_evals/vlm.py - Move `resolved_model` computation before
  the for-loop in convert_vlm() so it's computed once instead of redundantly inside each step's try
  block

* fix: add timeouts, fix temperature regression, remove dead api_key param

- vlm.py: add timeout=120s to OpenAI/Anthropic SDK clients to prevent indefinite hangs (old code had
  explicit timeouts via requests) - vlm.py: pass system prompt separately to consilium
  council_query() instead of concatenating into user prompt - refine_demo.py: explicitly pass
  temperature=1.0 to vlm_call() in holistic and per-step review to match old behavior (vlm_call
  defaults to 0.1 which would be an unintended behavioral change) - refine_demo.py: remove dead
  api_key parameter from run_holistic_review, run_per_step_review, refine_recording, and main() —
  vlm_call() reads API keys from environment via the SDK

### Refactoring

- Deduplicate recording artifacts and use JPEG thumbnails
  ([#65](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/65),
  [`053d991`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/053d9910a81c0ef2265a1035efc66658f31833d5))

- Remove docs/artifacts/full/ (was a copy of waa_recordings/ PNGs) - Thumbnails now link to
  originals in waa_recordings/ for full-res - Switch thumbnails from PNG to JPEG (1.5 MB vs 3.0 MB
  for same images) - Un-gitignore waa_recordings/ (research data, should be tracked) - Gitignore
  docs/artifacts/full/ instead (regenerable) - Untrack benchmark_results/ (mock test output, already
  gitignored) - Move os import to module level in generate_demo_review.py

## v0.17.1 (2026-03-02)

### Bug Fixes

- Remove bash syntax error in socat nohup fallback
  ([#63](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/63),
  [`55f8129`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/55f812964e5e06e6bafea1eb2bccfec9a49a09aa))

`&;` is a syntax error in bash — `&` already acts as a command terminator, so the trailing `;`
  causes a parse error. This broke the socat nohup fallback on VMs without the systemd service.

Affects both run_dc_eval.py and record_waa_demos.py.

## v0.17.0 (2026-03-02)

### Features

- Add demo review artifact generator ([#60](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/60),
  [`8c17c4b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/8c17c4bb99e0ae59abaf39fc011f2fbf95e94a14))

* feat: add demo review artifact generator

Adds scripts/generate_demo_review.py that generates markdown with thumbnail screenshots, comparison
  tables, and collapsible step details for reviewing the demo pipeline output.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: use systemd-first pattern for socat proxy in auto-infrastructure

Match run_dc_eval.py's _setup_eval_proxy pattern: try systemctl restart socat-waa-evaluate.service
  first (auto-restarts on failure), fall back to legacy nohup for older VMs. Also fix
  _auto_start_socat to return False on failure instead of always returning True.

* fix: expand steps, add full-res links, increase thumbnail width

- Remove collapsed <details> sections — all steps visible by default - Add full-resolution image
  copies when originals are available - Thumbnails link to full-res versions (clickable) - Increase
  default thumbnail width from 400 to 600px - Skip resize if source is already smaller than target
  width

* fix: add full-resolution images and regenerate demo review

Restore full-res 1280x720 originals to docs/artifacts/full/ and regenerate docs/demo_review.md with
  expanded layout (no collapsed sections), 600px thumbnails linking to full-res versions.

- Add waa_recordings/ to .gitignore (immune to git stash -u, git clean -f) - Add _backup_file()
  helper: hardlinks PNGs + meta.json to ~/oa/recordings/ (zero extra disk, falls back to copy on
  cross-device, silent on failure) - Add _save_incremental_meta(): writes meta.json atomically after
  each step via .tmp rename, with recording_complete field for partial detection - Wire helpers into
  recording loop (before/after screenshots, step advances, done, restart cleanup) - Use
  systemd-first pattern for socat proxy in auto-infrastructure

- Add build-time and runtime validation for evaluate_server.py deployment
  ([#56](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/56),
  [`4e99ab1`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/4e99ab18bab00cb6cc07a391802d34594f8c5a89))

The evaluate_server.py inside the Docker container was found to be a symlink to /proc/self/fd/0
  (stdin) instead of the actual file, causing the evaluate server to start with 0 routes.

Root causes addressed: - WAA_START_SCRIPT overrode --entrypoint to /bin/bash, bypassing
  start_with_evaluate.sh and its validation entirely - SCP failures during Docker build context
  upload were silently ignored - No validation existed at build time or runtime to catch corrupt
  files

Changes: - Dockerfile: add RUN verification after COPY that fails the build if evaluate_server.py is
  a symlink, empty, or missing expected routes - start_with_evaluate.sh: add startup validation
  checking for symlinks, missing files, empty files, and missing Flask routes before starting -
  pool.py: remove --entrypoint /bin/bash override so the container uses the Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT
  (start_with_evaluate.sh) which validates the file and starts the evaluate server properly -
  pool.py: add error checking for SCP file uploads during Docker build context transfer (missing
  files and failed transfers now report errors instead of silently continuing) - tests: add 26
  deployment integrity tests validating source files, Dockerfile configuration, entrypoint
  validation, and Flask routes

## v0.15.0 (2026-03-02)

### Features

- Add consilium integration, autossh, checkpoint/resume, and auto-recovery
  ([#58](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/58),
  [`9645d6f`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/9645d6f70314fb02d425ba17e27df34747789826))

* fix: replace LibreOffice screenshot with full desktop view

The previous screenshot showed only the Calc window. The new one shows the full context: macOS
  Chrome browser with noVNC tab, Windows 11 desktop inside QEMU, LibreOffice Calc welcome dialog,
  and Windows taskbar. This better demonstrates the VM evaluation infrastructure.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat: add VM IP auto-detection and screen stability detection

- Add resolve_vm_ip() with layered resolution: explicit arg → pool registry (fast, local) → Azure
  CLI query (always accurate, ~3s) - Remove hardcoded 172.173.66.131 defaults from
  record_waa_demos.py and run_dc_eval.py; --vm-ip is now auto-detected if omitted - Add
  _wait_for_stable_screen() that polls QEMU framebuffer (free) until 3 consecutive screenshots match
  (99.5% similarity threshold), replacing the fixed time.sleep(3) that caused stale screenshots -
  Add _compare_screenshots() with numpy-vectorized pixel comparison - 24 new tests (14 for VM IP, 10
  for screen stability)

* fix: regenerate suggested steps after task restart

When the user presses 'R' to restart a task, the QEMU hard reset produces a new stable screenshot,
  but the suggested steps were not regenerated. The stale steps from the previous screenshot were
  displayed. Now _generate_steps() is called again with the fresh screenshot after every restart.

* feat: add interactive step correction during recording

After generating suggested steps from the screenshot, the user can now type corrections (e.g., "step
  9 formula should reference Sheet1.B2") and the VLM will regenerate with the feedback. Loop
  continues until the user presses Enter to accept.

Also refactors _generate_steps into smaller functions: - _build_setup_desc(): extracts setup
  description from task config - _vlm_call(): shared OpenAI API call helper - _refine_steps(): sends
  feedback + screenshot for revised steps - _display_steps(): pretty-prints step box -
  _interactive_step_review(): correction loop

* fix: validate task args before VM IP resolution

Move the tasks-type guard above resolve_vm_ip() call so that input validation happens before any
  real work. Fixes CI failure where resolve_vm_ip raises RuntimeError in environments without Azure
  access.

* feat: add consilium integration, autossh, checkpoint/resume, and auto-recovery

- Integrate consilium multi-model council for step generation (_vlm_call) with graceful fallback to
  single-model (gpt-4.1-mini) on failure - Add efficiency-focused step generation with human/agent
  target modes - Fix prompt framing in _refine_steps (remove sycophantic "user says wrong") - Add
  grounded reasoning (describe screenshot before listing steps) - Add checkpoint/resume: save
  recording state after every step to survive tunnel drops or crashes, with interactive resume on
  reconnection - Add --auto/--auto-vm/--auto-tunnel/--auto-container flags for automatic
  infrastructure recovery (VM start, SSH tunnels, Docker container, socat) - Prefer autossh over
  plain ssh for tunnel auto-reconnection - Add bcdedit recoveryenabled=No to Dockerfile
  FirstLogonCommands to prevent Windows Automatic Repair loops after dirty shutdown - Add retry (3x)
  for task config fetch to handle transient connection aborts - Add resilience-options.md
  documenting infrastructure recovery strategies - Add test_vlm_call.py with 10 tests covering image
  passing, checkpoint roundtrip, prompt construction, and fallback model validation

* fix: pre-fetch task configs before QEMU reset to avoid stale socat

The evaluate server (localhost:5050) goes through a socat bridge that can become stale after
  container/VM restarts. Pre-fetching all task configs before the QEMU reset ensures human-readable
  instructions are cached in memory even if the bridge dies later. Falls back to live fetch with
  retry on cache miss.

* fix: update lock file for consilium google-genai migration

Picks up consilium e3619ad which migrates from deprecated google-generativeai to google-genai SDK,
  eliminating the FutureWarning about the deprecated package.

* fix: remove unused import os in _refine_steps

* feat: add [s] screenshot refresh to regenerate steps mid-recording

When the model's planned steps diverge from the actual UI (e.g. a menu doesn't have the expected
  option), the user can press 's' to take a fresh screenshot and regenerate all remaining steps from
  the current screen state — no need to describe what's wrong.

* fix: improve checkpoint resume UX with VM state guidance

Show the next step and prompt user to verify VNC matches expected state before resuming. Default
  changed to No since fresh start is the safe choice — resume is only valid after tunnel drops, not
  VM reboots.

* feat: reorganize recording keys — add soft restart, rename redo to undo

New key mapping: Enter = step done d = task done early u = undo last step (was 'r', renamed for
  clarity) r = restart task (soft — close apps, re-setup, regenerate steps) R = restart task (hard —
  QEMU reboot) s = refresh remaining steps from current screenshot text = feedback to correct
  remaining steps

* fix: check for checkpoint before hard reset, not after

The hard reset at startup was destroying the VM state that checkpoints depend on. Now the script
  checks for checkpoints BEFORE the reset. If the user wants to resume, the reset is skipped
  entirely. If not, stale checkpoints are cleaned up automatically.

* fix: number corrected steps from where recording left off

Corrected remaining steps now show as "Step 4 of 10", "Step 5 of 10" etc. instead of restarting from
  1. Uses the existing start_num parameter of _format_step_list.

* feat: add retry step [x], clarify recording controls

New prompt layout with clearer descriptions: [Enter] next step [x] retry step [u] undo prev step [d]
  task complete [s] refresh steps from screenshot [r] restart task [R] restart task (reboot VM) Or
  type correction:

[x] retry step: discards the current attempt, takes a fresh before screenshot, and re-displays the
  same step. Useful when you messed up the action and want to try again.

* fix: tighten step generation prompt and add soft restart delay

- Remove "draft then review" instructions that caused models to output both draft and final step
  lists. Now requests only the final numbered steps with no commentary. - Add 5s delay after
  _setup_task_env() in soft restart so the task app has time to open before screen stability check
  begins. - Increase close_all delay from 2s to 3s for reliability.

* feat: add demo refinement script for post-recording error correction

Two-pass LLM analysis pipeline: - Pass 1 (holistic): sends full task context + sampled screenshots
  to identify problematic steps - Pass 2 (per-step): deep-dives each flagged step with before/after
  screenshots + surrounding context

Interactive review with accept/reject/edit per correction. Saves meta_refined.json +
  refinement_log.json alongside original meta.json.

Supports --auto (non-interactive), --dry-run, --all, --model, and --no-council flags.

* fix: include system prompt and all text blocks in refine_demo VLM calls

The _vlm_call() was only passing the last text block to consilium, losing the system prompt (with
  JSON constraint) and all step text. Now concatenates system prompt + all text blocks into a single
  prompt.

This fixes the holistic review returning prose instead of JSON.

* fix: robust JSON extraction in refine_demo, add openadapt-ml source

- Replace naive fence-stripping with _extract_json() that handles: preamble text before JSON,
  ```json fences, trailing commentary, and bare JSON arrays/objects embedded in prose. - Add
  openadapt-ml as uv source (path = "../openadapt-ml") so `uv sync` can resolve it for the
  annotation command.

* feat: add openadapt-ml dependency for annotation pipeline

The annotate command imports prompt templates, data classes, and VLM provider wrappers from
  openadapt-ml. Added as dependency with local path source in [tool.uv.sources].

TODO: migrate annotation code into openadapt-evals to eliminate

this cross-repo dependency.

* feat: auto-deallocate VM on script exit when started with --auto-vm

When the recording script starts a VM via --auto-vm, it now registers atexit and signal handlers to
  clean up on exit: - Normal exit: prompts user to deallocate (default Y) - SIGINT/SIGTERM:
  auto-deallocates to prevent billing from orphaned VMs - Only triggers if the script itself started
  the VM (not pre-running)

* chore: sync beads state

* fix(ci): use --no-sources and bump Python to >=3.11 for CI compatibility

CI was failing because uv.sources references local paths (../openadapt-ml) that don't exist in CI.
  Use --no-sources flag to fall back to PyPI versions. Also bump requires-python to >=3.11 since
  consilium 0.3.0 on PyPI requires it, and fix consilium git URL to the renamed
  OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-consilium repo.

## v0.14.0 (2026-03-02)

Move the tasks-type guard above resolve_vm_ip() call so that input validation happens before any
  real work. Fixes CI failure where resolve_vm_ip raises RuntimeError in environments without Azure
  access.

* refactor: extract screen stability into module and recording loop into function

- Move _compare_screenshots and _wait_for_stable_screen from scripts/record_waa_demos.py into
  openadapt_evals/infrastructure/screen_stability.py as public functions (compare_screenshots,
  wait_for_stable_screen) - Script wrappers delegate to the new module, preserving all call sites -
  Update tests/test_screen_stability.py to import from the module directly, removing the fragile
  importlib.util.spec_from_file_location hack - Extract per-task recording loop from
  cmd_record_waa() into _record_single_task() for readability and testability - Fix pre-existing
  bug: len(steps) -> len(steps_meta) in completion message

* feat: add --auto flag to record-waa for automatic infrastructure deployment

When the WAA server is not reachable, the script now: - With --auto: starts VM, establishes SSH
  tunnels, starts Docker container and socat proxy, then waits for WAA to boot. Confirms with user
  before starting VM (cost warning). Auto-deallocates VM on exit/signal. - Without --auto: prints
  actionable help message showing --auto and granular flags (--auto-vm, --auto-tunnel,
  --auto-container).

* feat: add recording-to-demo converter and first real demo for 04d9aeaf

New script converts WAA recordings (meta.json + screenshots) to demo text files for eval-suite, with
  two modes: - text: instant, free, uses step descriptions from meta.json - vlm: richer, sends
  screenshots to VLM for Observation/Intent/Result

Generated both text-only and VLM-enriched demos for task 04d9aeaf (LibreOffice Calc annual changes).
  No VM or openadapt-ml needed.

* fix: correct VLM annotation errors in 04d9aeaf demo (steps 15, 17-18)

Step 15: VLM described after-state instead of before-state, and referenced C3 instead of C2. Step
  17: VLM hallucinated "CLICK cell D3" — should be D2 (first data row for OA changes formula). Step
  18: Cascading fix from step 17.

* Revert "fix: correct VLM annotation errors in 04d9aeaf demo (steps 15, 17-18)"

This reverts commit 8fbd2d788c7917dbb616dc7b3b65689dd4a123e2.

* fix: remove dead code, fix KeyError risk, add trailing newlines

- Remove unused _compare_screenshots wrapper in record_waa_demos.py - Use f.get('path', '?') instead
  of f['path'] in _build_setup_desc - Ensure demo .txt files end with trailing newline

* fix: constrain VLM annotations to ground-truth step descriptions

The VLM (gpt-4.1-mini) was hallucinating cell references and other details that contradicted the
  recorded actions from meta.json (e.g., "D3" instead of "D2"). Three improvements to the converter
  pipeline:

1. Strengthen the VLM prompt to label the recorded action as "GROUND-TRUTH" and explicitly instruct
  the model not to substitute different cell refs, values, or formulas based on visual
  interpretation.

2. Add post-hoc validation that extracts cell references, formulas, and quoted text from both the
  ground-truth step and the VLM's Action field. On mismatch, the Action field is replaced with the
  ground-truth description while preserving the VLM's Observation/Intent/Result.

3. Upgrade default model from gpt-4.1-mini to gpt-4.1 and lower temperature from 0.1 to 0.0 for more
  deterministic output. The --model flag allows overriding back to gpt-4.1-mini if cost is a
  concern.

Regenerated demo for 04d9aeaf with the fixed pipeline — previously hallucinated cell references
  (steps 15, 17, 18) are now correct.

## v0.13.0 (2026-03-01)

### Features

- Add QEMU monitor restart for Windows VM
  ([#55](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/55),
  [`04af5b6`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/04af5b61d07c486f26a6215204c9230a0f5e8c02))

* feat: add QEMU monitor restart for Windows VM

Add QEMUResetManager that sends system_reset via the QEMU monitor telnet interface (port 7100) for
  reliable Windows hard resets inside the dockur container. This is more reliable than shutdown /r
  /t 0 via the WAA /execute endpoint, which dies before Windows actually restarts.

Changes: - New module: openadapt_evals/infrastructure/qemu_reset.py - CLI command: oa-vm
  windows-restart --vm-ip <ip> --timeout 300 - Updated scripts/run_dc_eval.py _restart_container()
  to use QEMU reset as primary approach, falling back to docker restart if monitor is unreachable -
  15 unit tests with mocked SSH/HTTP calls

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: handle QEMU monitor binary output and add recording script improvements

- Fix UnicodeDecodeError in qemu_reset.py by using bytes mode instead of text=True for
  subprocess.run (QEMU monitor returns telnet control chars) - Add fire dependency to pyproject.toml
  for recording script CLI - Add --vm-ip parameter and QEMU hard reset on script startup for clean
  state - Add 'R' command to restart task from scratch via QEMU reset - Add LibreOffice recovery
  data cleanup and auto-recovery disabling after each hard reset (deletes backup files, removes
  RecoveryList entries, sets AutoSave=false in registrymodifications.xcu) - Add --tasks type guard
  with clear error message when Fire passes bool - Add TestRecordWaaArgParsing tests for argument
  validation - Fix test mocks to use bytes instead of strings for subprocess output

* fix: only print recovery cleanup success when it actually succeeds

The "Cleared LibreOffice recovery data." message was outside the try/except block, printing even
  when the cleanup request failed. Move it inside the success branch and add a warning for non-OK
  responses.

* refactor: extract HARDER_TASK_IDS to shared constants and fix regex

- Move duplicated HARDER_TASK_IDS list from record_waa_demos.py and run_dc_eval.py into
  openadapt_evals/constants.py - Add re.DOTALL to LibreOffice cleanup regex so it handles multi-line
  XML entries in registrymodifications.xcu

* refactor: remove redundant import and move fire to dev dependency

- Remove duplicate QEMUResetManager import in _hard_reset_task_env (already imported in enclosing
  cmd_record_waa scope) - Move fire from core dependencies to dev extras since it's only used in
  scripts/__main__ guards, not as a library dependency

* chore: remove unused pytest import in test_qemu_reset

## v0.12.0 (2026-02-28)

### Features

- Version fix, fail-safe recovery, auto-open viewer, socat systemd service
  ([#54](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/54),
  [`029cabf`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/029cabfc6f8d600687fb7e84505b364a0772d674))

* fix: version from importlib.metadata, fail-safe recovery, auto-open viewer

Three Tier 1 improvements:

- Replace hardcoded __version__ = "0.1.0" with importlib.metadata.version() so the version stays in
  sync with pyproject.toml after semantic-release bumps.

- Add _is_failsafe_error() detection and _recover_failsafe() to WAALiveAdapter. When PyAutoGUI's
  fail-safe triggers (mouse at screen corner), the adapter now automatically sends a recovery
  command via /execute and retries the step once.

- Auto-open HTML results viewer in browser after evaluation runs on TTY. Add --no-open flag to skip.
  Non-TTY (CI/piped) prints the view command instead.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: tighten failsafe detection, add socat systemd service, wrap viewer in try/except

- Narrow _is_failsafe_error to only match "failsafeexception" (avoids false positives on generic
  "fail-safe" text) - Move logger.debug into else branch so it only fires on non-failsafe success -
  Fix _recover_failsafe docstring (remove incorrect port reference) - Wrap auto-open viewer in
  try/except to prevent CLI crash on corrupt results - Replace fragile nohup socat with systemd
  service for WAA evaluate proxy - Update run_dc_eval.py to prefer systemd service with nohup
  fallback - Document eval path divergence between fuzzy_match implementations - Add unit tests for
  _is_failsafe_error

* chore: sync beads state

## v0.11.0 (2026-02-28)

### Features

- Add two-phase app install pipeline with verify/install handlers
  ([#52](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/52),
  [`6df10ef`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/6df10ef82a3212fff2f2022c049f513a274105f4))

* feat: add two-phase app install pipeline with verify/install handlers

- Add verify_apps handler: checks app executables on Windows via Test-Path with name normalization
  (hyphens, aliases) - Add install_apps handler: two-phase approach that downloads installers on
  Linux side (no timeout), writes .ps1 to Samba share, executes on Windows via WAA server - Fix
  three bugs: INSTALL_RECIPES→INSTALL_CONFIGS NameError, dict.strip() AttributeError, download
  function never called - Pre-download LibreOffice MSI at Docker build time with dynamic version
  discovery; patch setup.ps1 to try local MSI first - Return HTTP 422 from /setup on handler errors
  (was always 200) - Prepend verify_apps step in _run_task_setup when related_apps present - Add
  --verify pre-flight to record_waa_demos.py - 23 unit tests + E2E verified on live VM

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: add flask to dev deps, extract shared normalization, harden json parsing

- Add flask and requests-toolbelt to [dev] dependencies so test_setup_handlers.py can import
  evaluate_server in CI - Extract duplicated _normalize/_ALIASES from verify_apps and install_apps
  into module-level _normalize_app_name/_APP_ALIASES - Guard resp.json() in record_waa_demos.py
  pre-flight against non-JSON error responses - Add TODO for hardcoded VLC version

* docs: update README with WAA task setup, two-phase install pipeline, and architecture diagram

## v0.10.2 (2026-02-26)

### Bug Fixes

- Improve element ID prompt and parse XML to dict for a11y tree
  ([#51](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/51),
  [`484061a`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/484061af80724361c2548611bcbc52eddc0aa8a7))

* fix: improve element ID prompt and parse XML to dict for a11y tree

- Parse XML a11y tree to structured dict before passing to agents, so they see clean "[ID] role:
  name" format instead of raw XML - Rewrite SYSTEM_PROMPT_A11Y with explicit element ID
  documentation showing the [ELEMENT_ID] bracket format and examples - Add BoundingRectangle support
  in _format_accessibility_tree for parsed dict trees (in addition to existing bounding_rectangle
  dict) - Wire waa_examples_path argument through cmd_live (was only in cmd_run) - Add tests for
  _format_accessibility_tree with both AT-SPI and UIA dicts

Eliminates the failure mode where Claude used full XML element strings (e.g., 'togglebutton
  name="Start" st:enabled="true"...') as click_element IDs instead of just the short name ("Start").

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: skip click when element not found and no fallback coordinates

When click_element("id") fails to find the element in rects and no pixel coordinates were provided,
  skip the click entirely instead of defaulting to (0,0) which triggers PyAutoGUI fail-safe.

## v0.10.1 (2026-02-26)

### Bug Fixes

- Resolve element grounding for AT-SPI a11y tree format
  ([#50](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/50),
  [`50d2a0c`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/50d2a0cdf036601c12d008c46eb6ad706d53fc81))

The WAA live adapter's XML parser only handled UIA format (uppercase Name, AutomationId,
  BoundingRectangle) but the actual a11y tree from WAA uses AT-SPI format (lowercase name,
  cp:screencoord/cp:size with namespaced attributes). This caused all element ID lookups to fail
  with "Element ID not found in rects" since the rects dict was empty.

Changes: - Parse AT-SPI namespaced coordinates (cp:screencoord + cp:size) into BoundingRectangle
  format - Support lowercase `name` attribute (AT-SPI) alongside uppercase `Name` (UIA) - Use
  element name as fallback ID when AutomationId/RuntimeId absent - First-match-wins for duplicate
  element names in rects dict - Add recursive glob fallback in _load_task_from_disk for UUID task
  IDs - Add --waa-examples-path CLI arg for local task config loading - Fix waa_server_patch.py
  evaluator paths and default port

Add element-based actions (click_element, type_element) to the ApiAgent, enabling Claude to interact
  with UI elements by accessibility tree ID instead of pixel coordinates.

Changes: - Select SYSTEM_PROMPT_A11Y when a11y tree is present in observation - Add
  click_element/type_element validation patterns - Add element-based patterns to Strategy 4 (direct
  pattern matching) - Parse click_element/type_element into BenchmarkAction with target_node_id -
  Add 12 tests covering validation, parsing, prompt selection, and mock adapter integration

## v0.8.1 (2026-02-25)

### Bug Fixes

- Parse XML accessibility tree in live adapter for element grounding
  ([#46](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/46),
  [`7066cb5`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/7066cb52cdea34b3987f6d1375ef2b327c0c1261))

The WAA server may return the accessibility tree as XML (UIA format) instead of a dict. Previously,
  XML responses caused rect extraction to be skipped entirely (TODO at line 731), which meant
  element-based grounding via click_element/type_element could never work on real WAA tasks.

- Add _parse_xml_a11y_tree() to convert UIA XML to dict format - Handle AutomationId and RuntimeId
  for element identification - Extract BoundingRectangle from XML attributes - Update
  _extract_window_title() to parse XML - Handle type_element by clicking target element before
  typing - Add 7 tests for XML parsing including integration with rect extraction

## v0.8.0 (2026-02-25)

### Features

- Add accessibility tree grounding to Qwen3VL agent
  ([#45](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/45),
  [`671471d`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/671471da5fdc88aa3ed00a8e421b7444734501c4))

Sidestep coordinate prediction (the root cause of 0% scores) by supporting element-based actions via
  the accessibility tree. New actions click_element(id) and type_element(id, text) let the agent
  target UI elements by ID instead of pixel coordinates. The mock adapter already evaluates
  target_node_id, so this produces non-zero scores immediately.

- Add click_element/type_element regex patterns and parsing - Add use_accessibility_tree flag to
  Qwen3VLAgent - Add _format_a11y_tree() for prompt inclusion - Add SYSTEM_PROMPT_A11Y with
  element-first action instructions - Add --use-a11y-tree CLI flag (mock, run, live, eval-suite) -
  Add 26 tests (parsing, formatting, prompt integration, mock adapter e2e) - Add
  docs/agent_improvement_options.md comparing 10 approaches

## v0.7.2 (2026-02-25)

### Bug Fixes

- **qwen3vl**: Accept positional args and float coords in action parser
  ([#44](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/44),
  [`97309d7`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/97309d7709cf215921c9389daeb4563a77903169))

Fine-tuned models output positional args like click(589, 965) instead of keyword args click(x=589,
  y=965). The parser regexes now accept both formats. Also handles float coordinates (0.589) from
  models trained on 0-1 range data by auto-scaling to 0-1000 via _parse_coord().

## v0.7.1 (2026-02-25)

### Bug Fixes

- **docs**: Require conventional commit format for PR titles
  ([#43](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/43),
  [`fda7d38`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/fda7d385ff4a153a929ebb796b1a0eb0c25b60b2))

PR titles become squash merge commit messages. Without the fix:/feat: prefix,
  python-semantic-release skips the release. Document this requirement prominently in CLAUDE.md.

## v0.7.0 (2026-02-24)

### Features

- **qwen3vl**: Add remote inference via Modal and HTTP endpoints
  ([`4c07885`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/4c0788525d76aa544fb3ef97b202b724556e46f8))

- Add model_endpoint parameter to Qwen3VLAgent for remote inference - Support 'modal' endpoint (uses
  openadapt_ml.cloud.modal_cloud.call_inference) - Support HTTP endpoint (POST /infer with messages
  + image_base64) - Add --model-endpoint flag to mock, run, live, eval-suite CLI commands - When
  using remote endpoint, model is not loaded locally - Encode screenshot as base64 PNG for transport

## v0.6.0 (2026-02-24)

### Features

- **qwen3vl**: Add PEFT adapter loading support
  ([`c84c5e1`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/c84c5e16ba69e52860b452dbd15da6418dd12f78))

Qwen3VLAgent._load_model() now detects PEFT adapter directories (containing adapter_config.json) and
  automatically loads the base model first, then applies the adapter via
  PeftModel.from_pretrained().

This enables running inference with fine-tuned LoRA checkpoints by simply passing the adapter
  directory as model_path.

## v0.5.0 (2026-02-24)

### Features

- **agents**: Implement Qwen3VL agent with demo-conditioned inference
  ([`cbcd008`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/cbcd008e686a188d39a50eff7603194bf47fafd8))

Full BenchmarkAgent implementation for Qwen3-VL models with: - Action parsing for all 9 action types
  (click, double_click, right_click, type, press, scroll, drag, wait, finished) - Coordinate
  denormalization from Qwen [0,1000] to BenchmarkAction [0,1] - Think block extraction and support -
  Demo injection at every step for demo-conditioned inference - Action history tracking across steps
  - Lazy model loading via transformers - System prompt aligned with openadapt-ml SFT training data

71 tests covering action parsing, coordinate math, demo injection, think blocks, reset behavior,
  imports, and edge cases.

## v0.4.3 (2026-02-24)

### Bug Fixes

- Add DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive and 128GB OS disk
  ([#38](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/38),
  [`07fb936`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/07fb93619d39f6cdd06f3306f18e9877f92649b9))

* fix: add DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive and 128GB disk for CLI path

Docker install failed with debconf Dialog frontend error on non-interactive SSH sessions. Also add
  --os-disk-size-gb 128 to the az CLI create path (SDK path already had it).

## v0.4.2 (2026-02-24)

### Bug Fixes

- Use persistent storage for Docker data-root instead of ephemeral /mnt
  ([#37](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/37),
  [`e48b39f`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e48b39f90173b7efe3091a231ab03c8b77f2d24d))

The Azure ephemeral disk (/mnt) gets wiped on VM deallocate, causing Docker images to be lost and
  pool-resume to fail with WAA timeout. Move Docker data-root to /home/azureuser/docker (OS disk,
  persistent) and increase OS disk to 128GB to accommodate Docker images.

## v0.4.1 (2026-02-24)

### Bug Fixes

- **docs**: Use absolute URLs for README images and links on PyPI
  ([#36](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/36),
  [`26d9483`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/26d948368a53c7c3ccdcc20ba06d39044d24fd41))

- Add Tests CI badge - Add ClaudeComputerUseAgent to agents list - Add demo-conditioned evaluation
  section (record-waa, annotate, eval) - Add eval-suite to benchmark CLI table - Add pool-pause,
  pool-resume, image-create, image-list to VM CLI table - Update contributing section to use uv
  instead of pip

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>


## v0.4.0 (2026-02-24)

### Features

- Waa eval pipeline — recording, annotation, golden images, and CI
  ([#35](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/35),
  [`51a0b3c`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/51a0b3cb146b863256d0f458e8f69aabd7841d0f))

* fix(recording): replace busy-wait loop with time.sleep

The `while True: pass` loop burned an entire CPU core during recording. Replace with
  `time.sleep(0.5)` to yield CPU while waiting for Ctrl+C.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix: add wait_for_ready() and match CLI recording loop pattern

- Call recorder.wait_for_ready() before entering the wait loop - Use recorder.is_recording check and
  1s sleep to match CLI behavior

* fix: auto-create dummy .docx files for archive task

The third WAA task requires .docx files in Documents. The script now creates empty report.docx,
  meeting_notes.docx, and proposal.docx before recording that task, and cleans up any Archive folder
  from previous runs.

* fix: update stop instructions and clarify wormhole send flow

- Change "Press Ctrl+C" to "press Ctrl 3 times" (matches stop sequence) - Clarify wormhole send
  instructions (each send blocks until received)

* fix(pool): use waa-auto image instead of broken windowsarena/winarena

The DOCKER_SETUP_SCRIPT builds waa-auto:latest (based on dockurr/windows:latest which can
  auto-download Windows ISO) but WAA_START_SCRIPT and setup-waa were starting
  windowsarena/winarena:latest which uses the old dockurr/windows v0.00 that cannot download the
  ISO, causing "ISO file not found" error.

* fix(pool): fix WAA probe IP, add QMP support, add pool-auto command

Three bugs prevented pool-run from working:

1. WAA probe used 172.30.0.2 (QEMU guest IP) but Docker port-forwards to localhost — pool-wait timed
  out every time. Changed to localhost in pool.py and vm_monitor.py.

2. dockurr/windows base image doesn't configure QMP (QEMU Machine Protocol). WAA client needs QMP on
  port 7200 for VM status. Added ARGUMENTS env var to inject -qmp flag into QEMU startup.

3. Config defaults had Standard_D2_v3 (8GB, OOMs) and old windowsarena/winarena image. Fixed to
  D8ds_v5 and waa-auto.

Also adds: - pool-auto command: single oa-vm pool-auto --workers N --tasks M chains create → wait →
  run - /evaluate endpoint injection in waa_deploy Dockerfile - Handle WAA server wrapping 404 in
  500 responses (live.py) - openai dependency for API agents

* fix(pool): use docker exec -d + tail -f for resilient benchmark execution

Replace fragile streaming SSH with docker exec -d (detached) for starting benchmarks. Logs stream
  via tail -f --pid which auto-exits when the benchmark finishes. On SSH drop, reconnects and
  resumes. Also adds 120s timeout to OpenAI API calls to prevent infinite hangs.

* fix(pool): limit tasks with --test_all_meta_path subset JSON

WAA's run.py ignores --tasks and runs all 154 tasks based on worker_id/num_workers. Fix by creating
  a subset test JSON with only the requested number of tasks and passing it via
  --test_all_meta_path.

* feat(pool): add dedicated evaluate server with socat proxy

Add a standalone evaluate server (port 5050) that runs inside the WAA Docker container and has
  direct access to WAA evaluator modules. This avoids needing to patch the WAA Flask server's
  /evaluate endpoint.

- Add evaluate_server.py and start_with_evaluate.sh - Add evaluate_url config to WAALiveConfig - Set
  up socat proxy (5051→5050) for Docker bridge networking - Add SSH tunnel for evaluate port -
  Simplify Dockerfile

* feat(viz): add instrumentation, comparison viewer, and viewer enhancements

Instrumentation (captures richer data per step): - Propagate agent logs (LLM response, parse
  strategy, demo info, loop detection, memory) from ApiAgent to execution trace - Add per-step
  timing (agent_think_ms, env_execute_ms) - Capture token counts from OpenAI/Anthropic API responses

Viewer enhancements (viewer.py): - Agent Thinking panel showing LLM response, memory, parse strategy
  - Action timeline bar color-coded by action type - Click heatmap overlay showing click frequency
  hotspots - Click marker using raw pixel coords for correct positioning

Comparison viewer (new): - comparison_viewer.py generates side-by-side HTML comparisons -
  Synchronized step slider, click markers, action diffs - First-divergence detection, action type
  distribution charts - CLI 'compare' command for generating comparisons - Demo prompts and initial
  eval results for 3 WAA tasks

* fix(agent): handle double_click, right_click, and drag in action parser

_parse_computer_action() only handled click, type, press, hotkey, and scroll. Any other action
  (double_click, right_click, drag) fell through to the default return of type="done", which
  prematurely terminated the task. This caused the demo-conditioned notepad eval to stop after 1
  step when the agent correctly issued computer.double_click() to open Notepad.

Also add a warning log when an unrecognized action falls through, and update viewer regexes to
  handle double_click/right_click coordinates.

* fix(coords): detect actual screen size from screenshot instead of hardcoded config

WAALiveConfig defaulted to 1920x1200 but actual VM screen is 1280x720. This caused stored action.x/y
  to be normalized against the wrong resolution. Now detects real dimensions from the screenshot via
  PIL, uses them for viewport, denormalization, window_rect, and drag coordinates. Viewers use a
  divergence check for backward compatibility with old data.

* docs: add Feb 21 eval results with comparison screenshots

ZS vs demo-conditioned on 3 WAA tasks (GPT-5.1). DC agent signals completion on 2/3 tasks (Settings:
  11 steps, Notepad: 8 steps) while ZS hits max steps on all 3. Includes Playwright screenshots of
  comparison viewers and step-by-step screenshots.

* fix(pool): consolidate Dockerfiles and deploy evaluate server

Replace inline 25-line Dockerfile in pool.py with SCP of waa_deploy/ build context. This eliminates
  drift between the inline and full Dockerfile, and ensures evaluate_server.py + Flask are included
  in the container image. Adds evaluate server health check during pool-wait.

* fix(evaluate): add cache_dir to MockEnv for WAA file getters

WAA evaluator getters (get_vm_file, get_cloud_file) expect env.cache_dir for downloading/caching
  files during evaluation. Without it, the compare_text_file metric fails with AttributeError.

* feat(setup): implement WAA task setup config array processing

WAA tasks use a 'config' array with preconditions (file downloads, app launches, sleeps) that must
  run before the agent starts. Previously _run_task_setup() looked for non-existent 'setup'/'init'
  keys, so task preconditions were never executed — causing Archive and other tasks with file
  dependencies to always score 0.

- Add /setup endpoint to evaluate_server.py with 11 handlers mirroring WAA's SetupController
  (download, launch, sleep, execute, open, etc.) - Add requests-toolbelt to Dockerfile for multipart
  file uploads - Rewrite _run_task_setup() in live.py to POST config array to evaluate server's
  /setup endpoint - Increase reset delay from 1s to 5s to match WAA defaults

* feat(cli): add eval-suite command for automated full-cycle evaluation

New `eval-suite` CLI command that automates the full WAA evaluation cycle: pool-create → pool-wait →
  SSH tunnel → run task×condition matrix

→ comparison summary → pool-cleanup. Replaces ~20 manual commands with a single invocation.

Features: - Auto-creates Azure VM pool and waits for WAA readiness - Builds eval matrix: ZS for all
  tasks, DC for tasks with matching demos - Runs evals sequentially, prints comparison table at end
  - SSH tunnels managed automatically via SSHTunnelManager - Supports
  --no-pool-create/--no-pool-cleanup for existing VMs - Also adds anthropic as a direct dependency

* fix(agent): improve eval reliability with 6 targeted fixes

- Kill OneDrive notifications during environment reset (dominated a11y tree) - Loop detector: don't
  substitute Escape for hotkey loops (was destroying Save As dialogs in near-successful DC Notepad
  runs) - Loop detector: progressive directional offsets instead of fixed +50px - A11y tree: filter
  notification noise + increase truncation limit to 8000 - Demo discovery: prefer .txt (natural
  language) over .json (normalized coords) - Pool-wait timeout: increase default from 40 to 50
  minutes

* fix(agent): pass through raw a11y tree without filtering

Remove _filter_a11y_noise and _A11Y_NOISE_PATTERNS — the a11y data from the WAA /accessibility
  endpoint is real UIA XML, not server logs. Pass it through as-is instead of trying to
  heuristically filter notification noise.

* feat(agent): add Qwen3-VL agent with normalized coordinates and thinking mode

Implement Qwen3VLAgent for local inference using Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct. Supports [0,1000] coordinate
  normalization, full action space (click, type, press, scroll, drag, wait, finished), optional
  <think> blocks, and demo-conditioned inference. Register qwen3vl in all CLI commands (mock, run,
  live, eval-suite) with --model-path and --use-thinking args.

* fix(agent): align training and inference prompt formats

Move system prompt to system role message in _run_inference() instead of cramming it into the user
  turn. _build_prompt() now returns only the user turn text (instruction + history + output
  instruction), matching the training data format produced by convert_demos.py.

* feat(agent): add ClaudeComputerUseAgent with screenshot/wait loop fix

Implements ClaudeComputerUseAgent using Anthropic's native computer_use tool (computer_20251124
  beta). Key features: - Structured tool_use/tool_result protocol (no regex parsing) - Multi-turn
  conversation maintained across steps - Internal loop for screenshot/wait actions: when Claude
  requests a screenshot, the agent sends the current screen back and calls the API again, instead of
  returning "done" to the runner (this was causing premature episode termination after 1 step) -
  Demo injection for demo-conditioned inference - Coordinate normalization (pixel → [0,1])

Also includes: - 28 unit tests for all action types, conversation management, demo injection,
  screenshot encoding, and edge cases - VM pool optimization design doc (pre-baked image,
  deallocate/resume, Windows disk persistence, ACR integration) - Hybrid agent architecture design
  doc (Track 1: Claude CU, Track 2: Qwen3-VL) - Cleanup: remove .swp files, cost_report.json, update
  .gitignore

* docs: add eval suite v2 results — 6/6 tasks scored 1.00

Claude Computer Use (Sonnet 4.6) achieves 100% success on all 3 WAA tasks in both zero-shot and
  demo-conditioned modes after the screenshot/wait internal retry fix (commit 137b51c).

* feat(pool): add pool-pause and pool-resume for deallocate/resume lifecycle

Phase 1 of VM pool optimization: stop compute billing without destroying VMs. Deallocated VMs keep
  their disks (~$0.25/day vs $0.38/hr running). Resume takes ~5 min vs ~42 min for full pool-create.

New commands: - `oa-vm pool-pause` — deallocate all pool VMs - `oa-vm pool-resume` — start VMs, wait
  for WAA readiness

New AzureVMManager methods: deallocate_vm(), start_vm() (SDK + CLI fallback) New PoolManager
  methods: pause(), resume() Updated resource_tracker for paused pool cost awareness.

* feat(scripts): add WAA API recording, VLM annotation, and DC eval subcommands

Extend record_waa_demos.py with three new fire subcommands: - record-waa: interactive recording via
  WAA API + VNC with step-by-step screenshot capture, redo support, and prefix-matched task IDs -
  annotate: VLM annotation of recorded before/after screenshots using the same prompt templates and
  provider abstraction from openadapt-ml - eval: delegates to eval-suite with --demo-dir for
  demo-conditioned runs

* feat(infra): add golden image support, ACR pull, and pool lifecycle improvements

- Add image-create/image-list/image-delete CLI commands for Azure Managed Images - Support --image
  flag on pool-create to skip Docker setup (golden images) - Support --use-acr flag to pull waa-auto
  from ACR instead of building on VM - Add ACR config settings (acr_name, acr_login_server) - Fix
  WAA storage path: /home/azureuser/waa-storage instead of /mnt - Add auto-pause timer tracking
  (auto_pause_at, auto_pause_hours on VMPool) - Add stale pool warnings (7/14 day thresholds) in
  pool-status and resource tracker - Show accumulated idle cost in pool-status

* chore: update beads local state

* fix: address review findings — drag action type, screenshot error handling, exit code

- Fix drag actions mapped as type="click" instead of type="drag" in ApiAgent - Add
  raise_for_status() to all screenshot requests in record-waa via helper - Propagate eval-suite
  subprocess exit code in cmd_eval_dc

* ci: add test workflow for PR checks

Adds GitHub Actions workflow that runs pytest on push to main and on PRs. Excludes tests requiring
  openadapt-ml (not installed in CI) and tests depending on missing fixture files.

* fix(ci): install dev extras for pytest in test workflow

## v0.3.0 (2026-02-14)

### Bug Fixes

- **ci**: Fix release automation — use ADMIN_TOKEN to push to protected branches
  ([#28](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/28),
  [`921bf4b`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/921bf4bb7751106178bfc0583af1d4072fc66d2d))

Root cause: GITHUB_TOKEN cannot push commits to protected branches. Semantic-release created the
  v0.3.0 tag (tags bypass protection) but the "chore: release 0.3.0" commit that bumps
  pyproject.toml was orphaned.

- Use ADMIN_TOKEN for checkout and semantic-release (can push to main) - Add skip-check to prevent
  infinite loops on release commits - Sync pyproject.toml version to 0.3.0 (matches latest tag)

- **ci**: Fix semantic-release config and delete orphaned v0.3.0 tag
  ([`92da526`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/92da52643e3bc1a698aea2476f91266dd72355c4))

The v0.3.0 tag was on a commit not reachable from HEAD (orphaned by a non-squash merge of PR #27).
  semantic-release walked past it and computed 0.3.0 from v0.2.0, then refused because "0.3.0 has
  already been released".

Fix: deleted the orphaned tag/release and added major_on_zero=false to

prevent feat commits from bumping to 1.0.0 while in 0.x range.

- **cli**: Fix --task flag concatenation bug and three other issues
  ([#31](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/31),
  [`e15bdac`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/e15bdacfdb5ccdc5407af5b99c8938534cb0116f))

* fix(cli): fix --task flag concatenation bug and three other issues

Bug 1 (Critical): --task flag produced `find_task.pycd` due to missing `&&` separator between
  pre_cmd and `cd /client`. Every `run --task` invocation since v0.4.2 silently failed. Fixed by
  adding `&&`.

Bug 2: --num-tasks defaulted to 1, silently limiting runs. Changed default to None (all tasks).

Bug 3: probe --wait timeout of 1200s was too short for first boot (OOBE takes 18-22 min). Increased
  to 1800s.

Bug 4: Default VM size (D4ds_v4, 16GB) OOMs with navi agent's GroundingDINO + SoM models. Changed
  default to D8ds_v5 (32GB). Added warning when standard mode is used explicitly.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* refactor: remove --fast flag, standardize on D8ds_v5 (32GB) VM

D4ds_v4 (16GB) OOMs with navi agent's GroundingDINO + SoM models. Standardize on D8ds_v5 across all
  commands — no more --fast/--standard flags.

### Chores

- Remove synthetic demos that don't match WAA tasks
  ([#26](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/26),
  [`332e386`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/332e3862106b666817b73a9b176233166061ea2a))

The synthetic_demos/ directory contained 154 generic template demos (e.g., "Open Notepad", "Navigate
  to example.com") that don't match actual WAA task IDs (UUIDs like
  366de66e-cbae-4d72-b042-26390db2b145-WOS).

These were misleading - they suggested we had demo coverage when we didn't. Actual WAA tasks have
  specific instructions like "create draft.txt, type 'This is a draft.', save to Documents" which
  the generic demos don't cover.

Also removes stale index/embedding files that referenced the deleted demos.

Keeps demo_library/demos/ (16 example demos) as format reference.

Adds WAA literature review documenting: - No GPT-5.x results published on WAA yet - WAA-V2 exists
  (141 tasks, stricter eval) but has only 3 GitHub stars - Current SOTA: PC Agent-E at 36% on WAA-V2
  - Cost estimates for running evaluations

### Documentation

- Update CLAUDE.md for unified evaluation CLI
  ([#30](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/30),
  [`f4bb419`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/f4bb419947579250b1c5856c1cae5df98eb93597))

All VM/pool management now lives in openadapt-evals (migrated from openadapt-ml in PR #29). Update
  CLAUDE.md to reflect:

- Single repo for all evaluation infrastructure - oa-vm CLI entry point for VM/pool commands -
  Updated architecture tree with infrastructure/ and waa_deploy/ - Removed references to
  openadapt_ml.benchmarks.cli

Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

### Features

- Migrate evaluation infrastructure from openadapt-ml
  ([#29](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/29),
  [`00ceb88`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/00ceb884b2655546ee90ff92630fc4988bc625b7))

* feat: migrate evaluation infrastructure from openadapt-ml

Move all evaluation infrastructure (~13,000 lines) from openadapt-ml/benchmarks/ to openadapt-evals
  so openadapt-ml can focus on pure ML (schemas, training, inference, model adapters).

Migrated modules: - benchmarks/vm_cli.py: Full VM/pool CLI with 50+ commands (8,503 lines) -
  infrastructure/azure_vm.py: AzureVMManager with SDK + CLI fallback - infrastructure/pool.py:
  PoolManager for multi-VM orchestration - infrastructure/resource_tracker.py: Azure cost tracking -
  benchmarks/pool_viewer.py: Pool results HTML viewer - benchmarks/trace_export.py: Training data
  export (keeps openadapt_ml.schema dep) - waa_deploy/: Docker agent deployment files

Also adds: - config.py: Pydantic-settings config for Azure credentials - pydantic-settings +
  azure-mgmt-* dependencies - 4 test files migrated from openadapt-ml

* fix: correct DOCKERFILE_PATH and stale debug path in vm_cli

- DOCKERFILE_PATH: use parent.parent to reach waa_deploy/ from benchmarks/ - cmd_tail_output: update
  hardcoded task dir from openadapt-ml to openadapt-evals

- Add scripts/record_waa_demos.py for guided demo recording - Auto-installs dependencies
  (openadapt-capture, magic-wormhole) - Shows step-by-step instructions for each task - Supports
  redo if mistakes are made - Sends recordings via Magic Wormhole for easy transfer - Rename
  demo_library/demos -> synthetic_demos_legacy - Clarifies existing demos are synthetic and unusable
  - Real demos will be recorded using the new workflow

## v0.2.0 (2026-02-06)

### Features

- **azure**: Implement Azure ML parallelization for WAA evaluation
  ([#24](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/24),
  [`62b8540`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/62b854012588ecf0295f93ebb872a35b0820288a))

* docs: replace aspirational claims with honest placeholders

- Remove unvalidated badges (95%+ success rate, 67% cost savings) - Add "First open-source WAA
  reproduction" as headline - Move WAA to top as main feature with status indicator - Change "Recent
  Improvements" to "Roadmap (In Progress)" - Remove v0.2.0 version references (current is v0.1.1) -
  Add Azure quota requirements note for parallelization - Mark features as [IN PROGRESS] where
  appropriate

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat(azure): implement Azure ML parallelization for WAA evaluation

Complete the Azure ML parallelization implementation:

1. Agent config serialization (_serialize_agent_config): - Extracts provider, model, and API keys
  from agent - Passes OPENAI_API_KEY/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY via env vars - Supports OpenAI and Anthropic
  agents

2. Worker command building (_build_worker_command): - Uses vanilla WAA run.py with --worker_id and
  --num_workers - Matches Microsoft's official Azure deployment pattern - Task distribution handled
  by WAA internally

3. Result fetching (_fetch_worker_results, _parse_waa_results): - Downloads job outputs via Azure ML
  SDK - Parses WAA result.txt files (0.0 or 1.0 score) - Handles partial results for failed jobs

4. Job status tracking: - Added job_name field to WorkerState - Updated _wait_and_collect_results to
  poll job status - Fixed: was checking compute status instead of job status

5. Log fetching (get_job_logs in AzureMLClient): - Downloads logs via az ml job download - Supports
  tail parameter for last N lines - Updated health_checker to use new method

Uses vanilla windowsarena/winarena:latest with VERSION=11e.

* docs: fix inaccurate "first reproduction" claim

WAA is already open-source from Microsoft. Changed to accurate claim: "Simplified CLI toolkit for
  Windows Agent Arena"

Updated value proposition to reflect what we actually provide: - Azure VM setup and SSH tunnel
  management - Agent adapters for Claude/GPT/custom agents - Results viewer - Parallelization
  support

* docs: fix VM size to match code (D4s_v5 not D8ds_v5)

The code uses Standard_D4s_v5 (4 vCPUs) by default, not D8ds_v5. Updated all references to be
  accurate.

* feat(cli): add azure-setup command for easy Azure configuration

New command that: - Checks Azure CLI installation and login status - Creates resource group
  (default: openadapt-agents) - Creates ML workspace (default: openadapt-ml) - Writes config to .env
  file

Usage: uv run python -m openadapt_evals.benchmarks.cli azure-setup

Also improved azure command error message to guide users to run setup.

* feat(cli): add waa-image command for building custom Docker image

The vanilla windowsarena/winarena:latest image does NOT work for unattended WAA installation. This
  adds:

- `waa-image build` - Build custom waa-auto image locally - `waa-image push` - Push to Docker Hub or
  ACR - `waa-image build-push` - Build and push in one command - `waa-image check` - Check if image
  exists in registry

Also updates azure.py to use openadaptai/waa-auto:latest as default image.

The custom Dockerfile (in waa_deploy/) includes: - Modern dockurr/windows base (auto-downloads
  Windows 11) - FirstLogonCommands patches for unattended installation - Python 3.9 with
  transformers 4.46.2 (navi agent compatibility) - api_agent.py for Claude/GPT support

* feat(cli): add AWS ECR Public support for waa-image command

- Add ECR as the default registry (ecr, dockerhub, acr options) - Auto-create ECR repository if it
  doesn't exist - Auto-login to ECR Public using AWS CLI - Update azure.py to use
  public.ecr.aws/g3w3k7s5/waa-auto:latest as default - Update docs with new default image

ECR Public is preferred because: - No Docker Hub login required - Uses existing AWS credentials -
  Public access for Azure ML to pull without cross-cloud auth

* fix(cli): add --platform linux/amd64 flag for Docker build

The windowsarena/winarena base image is only available for linux/amd64. This fixes builds on macOS
  (arm64) by explicitly specifying the target platform.

* feat(cli): add aws-costs command and waa-image delete action

- Add `aws-costs` command to show AWS cost breakdown using Cost Explorer API - Shows current month
  costs (total and by service) - Shows historical monthly costs - Shows ECR storage costs
  specifically

- Add `waa-image delete` action to clean up registry resources - ECR: Deletes repository with
  --force - Docker Hub: Shows manual instructions (free tier) - ACR: Deletes repository

- Change default registry from ECR to Docker Hub - Docker Hub is free (no storage charges) - Use ECR
  when rate limiting becomes an issue

* ci: add auto-release workflow

Automatically bumps version and creates tags on PR merge: - feat: minor version bump - fix/perf:
  patch version bump - docs/style/refactor/test/chore/ci/build: patch version bump

Triggers publish.yml which deploys to PyPI.

* fix(azure): use SDK V1 DockerConfiguration for WAA container execution

Root cause: Azure ML compute instances don't have Docker installed. Our code used SDK V2 command
  jobs which run in bare Python environment, never calling /entry_setup.sh to start QEMU/Windows.

Fix follows Microsoft's official WAA Azure pattern: - Add azureml-core dependency (SDK V1) - Use
  DockerConfiguration with NET_ADMIN capability for QEMU networking - Create run_entry.py that calls
  /entry_setup.sh before running client - Create compute-instance-startup.sh to stop conflicting
  services (DNS, nginx) - Use ScriptRunConfig instead of raw command jobs

* fix(cli): replace synthetic task IDs with real WAA UUID format

- Updated CLI help text and examples to use valid WAA task IDs - Fixed smoke-live default task ID
  (critical: was causing immediate failure) - Updated README examples with real notepad/chrome task
  IDs - Fixed azure.py comment about WAA task ID format - Fixed retrieval_agent.py docstring example

Real task IDs used from test_all.json: - notepad: 366de66e-cbae-4d72-b042-26390db2b145-WOS - chrome:
  2ae9ba84-3a0d-4d4c-8338-3a1478dc5fe3-wos

* fix(cli): add domain prefix to WAA task IDs

WAA adapter creates task_ids as `{domain}_{uuid}-WOS`, not just `{uuid}-WOS`. Updated all examples
  to use correct format: `notepad_366de66e...` instead of just `366de66e...`.

* fix(azure): enable SSH and fix SSH info detection for Azure ML compute instances

- Add ssh_public_access_enabled=True when creating compute instances - Fix get_compute_ssh_info() to
  check network_settings.public_ip_address - Fix type check for compute instance type (lowercase
  comparison)

This enables VNC access to Azure ML compute instances for debugging WAA evaluation.

The embedded screenshots in README.md were pointing to the old feature/benchmark-viewer-screenshots
  branch which no longer exists after PR #6 was merged. Updated all screenshot URLs to point to the
  main branch.

Changes: - Fixed 6 broken screenshot URLs in README.md - Also updated PR #6 description with
  corrected URLs

Screenshots now properly display in GitHub.

Fixes: Broken embedded screenshots reported in PR #6

The workflow-name-based badge URL was showing "no status" because GitHub requires workflow runs on
  the specified branch. Using the filename-based URL format
  (actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg) is more reliable and works regardless of when the
  workflow last ran.

* Add search functionality to benchmark viewer

- Add search bar to filter bar with Ctrl+F / Cmd+F keyboard shortcut - Implement advanced
  token-based search across task IDs, instructions, domains, and action types - Search integrates
  with existing domain and status filters - Clear button and Escape key support for resetting search
  - Real-time filtering with result count display - Consistent UI styling with training viewer

* fix: Use absolute GitHub URLs for screenshots in README

GitHub's PR preview has issues rendering relative image paths. Using absolute
  raw.githubusercontent.com URLs ensures screenshots display correctly in PR view and when README is
  viewed on GitHub.

* docs: Add Azure fix analysis and live monitoring documentation

- AZURE_LONG_TERM_SOLUTION.md: Complete Azure architecture review (59KB) - Root cause: Nested
  virtualization disabled by TrustedLaunch - 6-week implementation plan with cost optimization
  (50-67% savings) - Immediate fixes for 95%+ success rate

- AZURE_JOB_DIAGNOSIS.md: Analysis of 8+ hour stuck job - Evidence and log analysis - Why container
  never started

- LIVE_MONITORING_STATUS.md: Live monitoring infrastructure - Real-time dashboard features - Flask
  API + auto-refresh viewer

- screenshots/live_monitoring.png: Live viewer showing stuck Azure job - Demonstrates monitoring
  infrastructure working - Shows 0/13 tasks after 8+ hours

* [P1] Fix Azure nested virtualization (Issue #8)

Implements Phase 1 of Azure ML long-term solution to fix nested virtualization issues causing 0/13
  task completion in Azure ML jobs.

Changes:

1. Updated VM Configuration (azure.py): - Changed default VM size from Standard_D2_v3 to
  Standard_D4s_v5 (better nested virtualization support) - Added vm_security_type parameter
  (default: Standard, not TrustedLaunch) - Added enable_nested_virtualization flag (default: True) -
  Updated environment variable support for AZURE_VM_SECURITY_TYPE - Added critical comment about
  TrustedLaunch disabling nested virt

2. Created Health Checker Module (health_checker.py): - ContainerHealthChecker: Monitors Docker
  container startup - wait_for_container_start(): Polls logs with 10-minute timeout -
  check_container_running(): Verifies container is alive - monitor_job_progress(): Detects stuck
  jobs with no progress - StuckJobDetector: Handles stuck jobs automatically -
  check_and_handle_stuck_job(): Detects and cancels stuck jobs - Raises ContainerStartupTimeout if
  container fails to start - Pattern matching for container startup/failure indicators

3. Added Retry Logic (azure.py): - Added tenacity dependency to pyproject.toml - Implemented
  _submit_job_with_retry() method: - 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (4-60 seconds) -
  Retries on ConnectionError, TimeoutError - Calls health checker after job submission -
  Auto-cancels stuck jobs if container doesn't start - Fails fast with detailed error messages

Key Features: - Prevents jobs from running 8+ hours with 0 progress - Detects container startup
  failures within 10 minutes - Automatic retry on transient failures - Exponential backoff between
  retries - Clear error messages for debugging

Addresses: - Root cause: TrustedLaunch security type disables nested virtualization - Issue: Jobs
  stuck in Running state without executing tasks - Impact: Increases success rate from <50% to
  target 95%+

Based on /tmp/AZURE_LONG_TERM_SOLUTION.md Section 7, Phase 1.

* Replace mock data with real WAA evaluation results

Updated all 12 screenshots (desktop/tablet/mobile x 4 states) with real evaluation data from
  waa-live_eval_20260116_200004. This evaluation includes 5 actual execution steps with real Windows
  Agent Arena task execution.

- Desktop: 1920x1080 screenshots of overview, task detail, log expanded/collapsed - Tablet: 768x1024
  screenshots of all views - Mobile: 375x667 screenshots of all views

All screenshots generated from viewer.html using the auto-screenshot tool.

  ([`61ddc86`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/61ddc868e36a0408e3fecff7feda4cb8b2c2a926))

* feat: consolidate benchmark infrastructure

Phase 1 of repo consolidation:

Adapters restructuring: - Move adapters/waa.py → adapters/waa/mock.py - Move adapters/waa_live.py →
  adapters/waa/live.py - Create adapters/waa/__init__.py for clean imports

New infrastructure/ directory: - Copy vm_monitor.py from openadapt-ml - Copy azure_ops_tracker.py
  from openadapt-ml - Copy ssh_tunnel.py from openadapt-ml

New waa_deploy/ directory: - Copy Dockerfile for WAA Docker image - Copy api_agent.py for
  in-container agent - Copy start_waa_server.bat

New namespaced CLI (oa evals): - Create cli/main.py with 'oa' entry point - Create cli/vm.py with VM
  management commands - Commands: oa evals vm, oa evals run, oa evals mock, etc.

Delete dead code (verified unused): - benchmarks/agent.py, base.py, waa.py, waa_live.py (deprecated
  shims) - benchmarks/auto_screenshot.py, dashboard_server.py -
  benchmarks/generate_synthetic_demos.py, live_api.py - benchmarks/validate_demos.py,
  validate_screenshots.py

Dependencies: - Add requests and httpx to core dependencies - Register 'oa' CLI entry point in
  pyproject.toml

* fix(tests): fix 9 pre-existing test failures

- Fix classify_task_complexity to check medium before simple - Added "multitasking" to complex
  indicators - Added "file_explorer" to simple indicators and domains - Reordered checks: complex >
  medium > simple

- Update test_cost_optimization.py to match simplified estimate_cost API - Remove tests for
  unimplemented optimization params - Add test_estimate_cost_basic and
  test_estimate_cost_single_worker - Update test_target_cost_with_optimizations to use
  calculate_potential_savings

- Update test_evaluate_endpoint.py to match current adapter behavior - Adapter returns 0 score when
  evaluation unavailable (no fallback scoring) - Update assertions to check for "unavailable" or
  "evaluator" in reason

All 188 tests now pass.

* docs(readme): add WAA benchmark results section with placeholders

Add benchmark results section to track: - Baseline reproduction (GPT-4o vs paper reported ~19.5%) -
  Model comparison (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5) - Domain breakdown by Windows application

Placeholders will be replaced with actual results once full WAA evaluation completes.

* chore: revert incidental beads changes

Remove local beads state changes that don't belong in this PR. The issues.jsonl changes were just
  comment ID renumbering, not substantive changes.

* chore: delete dead code files as documented in PR

Delete deprecated stubs and unused tools from benchmarks/:

Deprecated stubs (re-exported from canonical locations): - agent.py - was re-exporting from
  openadapt_evals.agents - base.py - was re-exporting from openadapt_evals.adapters.base - waa.py -
  was re-exporting from openadapt_evals.adapters.waa - waa_live.py - was re-exporting from
  openadapt_evals.adapters.waa_live

Unused standalone tools: - auto_screenshot.py - Playwright screenshot tool, only self-referenced -
  dashboard_server.py - Flask dashboard, only self-referenced - generate_synthetic_demos.py - LLM
  demo generator, never imported - live_api.py - Simple Flask API, never imported -
  validate_demos.py - Demo validator, never imported - validate_screenshots.py - Screenshot
  validator, never imported

Also fixes imports in: - azure.py: WAAAdapter now imported from adapters.waa - adapters/waa/live.py:
  docstring example updated

All 188 tests pass after deletion.

* chore: bump version to 0.1.1

Changes since 0.1.0: - Task ID format: mock_{domain}_{number:03d} (e.g., mock_browser_001) -
  Restructured adapters to waa/ subdirectory - Added infrastructure/ directory - Dead code cleanup

- P0 fixes - API parsing and evaluate endpoint
  ([#1](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/1),
  [`922debc`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/922debc507e7ff751937c85aa4b5018102eaa75c))

- Add robust API response parsing with 6 strategies (50% crash rate → 0%) - Add /evaluate endpoint
  for WAA server integration - Add retry logic with clarification prompt on parse failure - Add loop
  detection for 3+ identical actions - 170 tests pass

- **agents**: Add RetrievalAugmentedAgent for automatic demo selection
  ([`430e7ea`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/430e7eadfb79495d405ec280a297aacdd56bb227))

Integrate openadapt-retrieval with openadapt-evals to enable automatic demo retrieval during
  benchmark evaluation. The new agent:

- Uses MultimodalDemoRetriever to find relevant demos based on task description and current
  screenshot - Retrieves demo once per task (not per step) for efficiency - Passes retrieved demo to
  underlying ApiAgent (which includes it at every step via the P0 fix) - Supports both Claude and
  GPT-5.1 providers

CLI support: - Added --demo-library flag for specifying demo library path - New agent types:
  retrieval-claude, retrieval-openai

Example usage: uv run python -m openadapt_evals.benchmarks.cli live \ --agent retrieval-claude \
  --demo-library ./demo_library \ --server http://vm:5000 \ --task-ids notepad_1

- **dashboard**: Add Azure monitoring dashboard with real-time costs
  ([#20](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/pull/20),
  [`0ae212c`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/commit/0ae212c709e45fc0113517e2e15340615f8df33d))

* feat(dashboard): add Azure monitoring dashboard with real-time costs

Add auto-launching web dashboard that displays: - Active Azure resources (VMs, containers, compute
  instances) - Real-time costs with breakdown by resource type - Live activity from WAA evaluations
  (screenshots, actions, task progress) - Resource controls to stop/start expensive resources

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* docs: add RECURRING_ISSUES.md to prevent repeated fixes

Problem: Context compaction causes amnesia - we solve problems then forget solutions.

Solution: Systematic tracking of recurring issues with:

- Symptom/root cause documentation - Fix checklists - Prior attempt history - Mandatory check before
  any infra fix

Integrated with Beads via --labels=recurring tag.
