"""Planner-Grounder agent for GUI automation.

Separates "what to do" (planner) from "where to click" (grounder).

The planner sees the screenshot + accessibility tree and outputs a
high-level instruction. The grounder sees the screenshot + instruction
and outputs precise pixel coordinates.

This architecture follows the planner-grounder paradigm established in
the GUI agent literature. The separation of planning (high-level action
selection) from grounding (precise element localization) is a
well-established pattern with extensive prior art.

Usage:
    from openadapt_evals.agents import PlannerGrounderAgent

    # Both planner and grounder as API model names
    agent = PlannerGrounderAgent(
        planner="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        grounder="gpt-4.1-mini",
        planner_provider="anthropic",
        grounder_provider="openai",
    )

    # Planner as existing agent instance, grounder via HTTP
    agent = PlannerGrounderAgent(
        planner=my_api_agent,
        grounder="http",
        grounder_provider="http",
        grounder_endpoint="http://gpu-box:8080",

IMPORTANT: Every action you take MUST work toward completing the task above.
Do NOT open or interact with applications that the task does not require.
If you see icons on the desktop (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Recycle Bin) that are NOT
related to your task, IGNORE them. Only interact with what the task asks for.

If the application you need is not visible on the desktop or taskbar:
- Use the Start menu (click the Start button or press the Windows key)
- Or use Win+R (Run dialog) to launch it by name
- Do NOT default to clicking desktop icons that are unrelated to your task

Previous actions:
{action_history}

Accessibility tree:
{a11y_tree}
{demo_guidance}
Look at the screenshot and decide the next action to advance the TASK above.

Output a JSON object with exactly these fields:
{{"decision": "COMMAND" | "DONE" | "FAIL",
  "action_type": "click" | "double_click" | "type" | "key" | "scroll",
  "action_value": "<text to type, key to press, or empty for click/double_click>",
  "target_description": "<exact UI element: button label, menu item name, field placeholder, or precise visual description. To activate a window, specify exactly where to click it (e.g. its title bar).>",
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation of how this action advances the task>"}}

Rules:
- action_type must be exactly ONE of: click, double_click, type, key, scroll
- For click: target_description describes WHAT to click. action_value is empty. Use for buttons, menus, links, and UI controls.
- For double_click: use to open/launch applications, files, or desktop icons. action_value is empty.
- For type: action_value is the text to type. Append \\n to submit/press Enter after typing.
- For key: action_value is the key (e.g., "Enter", "Tab", "Ctrl+A").
- For scroll: action_value is "up" or "down".
- Output ONE action per response. Never combine multiple actions.
- Do NOT include pixel coordinates — a grounding model handles that.
- If there are dialog boxes, notifications, or popups blocking your target, dismiss them first (click X, press Escape, or click 'Not now'/'Later'/'Skip').
- If your last 3 actions were the same and failed, you MUST try a completely different approach: dismiss any dialogs, try keyboard shortcuts, or interact with different UI elements.
- Your reasoning MUST explain how the action relates to the task instruction.
